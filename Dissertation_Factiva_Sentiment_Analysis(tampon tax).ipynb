      "10 And sometimes, by which we mean every month for roughly 30 years, it’ downright expensive.\n",
      "11 If periods are the price women pay for the ability to make new humans, the “tampon tax”—ales tax applied to sanitary products —s the price they pay, er, because the government can make them.\n",
      "12 Just think of the taxman as a particularly audacious low-cost airline charging you to use the bathroom on a plane.\n",
      "13 You can understand why it’ making people mad.\n",
      "14 From Australia to Italy, Malaysia to the UK, many of the countries that charge tampon tax now find themselves the targets of a growing campaign to have such levies scrapped.\n",

      "16 And which countries make them do it?\n",
      "17 Sorry, sisters: It’ more than you might think.\n",
      "18 What is tampon tax?\n",
      "19 What the world has alliteratively nicknamed the tampon tax really applies not just to those but also to sanitary towels, panty liners, keepers (reusable devices that collect menstrual flow internally) and anything else women buy to stop their monthly blood from running all down their legs.\n",
      "20 Most governments around the world add on a consumption tax when customers purchase these items, just as they do for the vast majority of goods and services.\n",
      "21 What we pay in tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase price, according to a rate decided by the government.\n",
      "22 Unlike lots of other things we pay tax on, however, pre-made sanitary protection is something that millions of women and girls cannot do without, month after month and year after year.\n",
      "23 For them to pay the government a percentage on top of paying for those products is, critics say, an unfair burden on women’ wallets —hich are all too frequently slimmer than men’ to begin with.\n",
      "24 Everyone pays tax on everything they buy, though, right?\n",
      "25 Not exactly.\n",

      "27 Alternatively they can tax them at a lower rate than other, non-essential items.\n",

      "32 Here are a few examples.\n",
      "33 United States: between 4 and 9 percent  Sales tax varies from state to state and of the 50 in the union, only five waive it on sanitary goods: Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.\n",
      "34 Five others don’ have a sales tax.\n",
      "35 The rest do, and don’ exempt tampons from it.\n",
      "36 United Kingdom: 5 percent  In 1973, the UK began charging women 17.5 percent to buy tampons and pads.\n",
      "37 Things changed in 2001 when campaigners managed to get VAT, value-added tax, on sanitary goods reduced to 5 percent.\n",
      "38 A new generation of activists is now seeking to have that cut to zero.\n",
      "39 They want VAT on period paraphernalia brought in line with that on —or instance —erbal tea, bingo, printed music, antiques, helicopters and “xotic meat: horse, ostrich, crocodile, kangaroo, etc,”ll of which are zero-rated for VAT.\n",
      "40 Because, as this \"Bad Blood\" parody asks, what can women use instead?\n",

      "42 The government’ response is that it can’ abolish the tampon tax altogether, since the European Union forbids members from lowering VAT below 5 percent.\n",
      "43 (They can only maintain the 0 percent rate on goods that were already benefiting from it at the time EU legislation came in).\n",
      "44 Malaysia: 6 percent  The tampon tax became a hot issue in Malaysia earlier this year when the government overhauled the way it taxes consumers for shopping.\n",
      "45 Under a new goods and services tax (GST) introduced in April, women pay 6 percent VAT on sanitary items.\n",
      "46 The government marketed it as an improvement on an earlier 10 percent sales tax and promised that prices would go down.\n",
      "47 In reality, women complain, the reform —hich changed not just the rate but the way tax was calculated —as seen prices increase.\n",
      "48 What’ more, campaigners have started a petition for Malaysia’ tampon tax to be scrapped altogether, arguing that it “nfringes on our basic rights to access sanitary aid.”  Australia: 10 percent  Even the Aussie prime minister’ sister is fed up of paying a 10 percent GST on her sanitary stuff.\n",

      "50 The women of Down Under have led one of the liveliest campaigns this year against the tampon tax, which they claim swells the government’ coffers by roughly 25 million Australian dollars each year.\n",

      "123 Two members of California's state assembly are trying to give residents a tax break with a bill that would exempt tampons and sanitary napkins from the state's sales tax.\n",
      "124 There's precedent for this idea.\n",
      "125 Most sales taxes, including California's, exempt various necessities.\n",
      "126 Legislators have done this to shield lower-income consumers from tax on the things they must buy in daily life -- like food.\n",
      "127 While 45 states collect a sales tax, only 13 of them charge it on groceries.\n",
      "128 Only one state -- Illinois -- charges sales tax on prescription drugs.\n",
      "129 As Cristina Garcia, a state Assembly member, points out, tampons are pretty necessary.\n",
      "130 ''You can't just ignore your period,'' she said in a statement.\n",
      "131 So why shouldn't tampons get the same tax break as other necessities?\n",
      "132 It's a question that's been debated in legislatures around the world, with tampon tax cuts adopted in Canada and rejected in France last year.\n",
      "133 Five states have already created tax exemptions for tampons.\n",
      "134 One, Pennsylvania, threw in a tax break for toilet paper and diapers, reasoning that these items also seemed pretty necessary.\n",
      "135 Individually, these exemptions make a lot of sense.\n",
      "136 But as arguments for tax exemptions have gotten sympathetic ears in state capitals over the decades, states' sales tax revenues have suffered.\n",
      "137 ''Legislatures always love to give the base away,'' said John Mikesell, an expert on sales taxes at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.\n",
      "138 By his calculations, the typical state sales tax is applied to just 36 percent of that state's residents' personal income in 2012, down from nearly 60 percent in the late 1970s.\n",
      "139 That means the average American spends less than half of his or her income on items subject to sales tax.\n",
      "140 In California, the sales tax is already narrower than the national average, applying to just 27 percent of state residents' incomes.\n",
      "141 Sales tax bases have shrunk over time partly because states have created new exemptions, partly because untaxed online sales have expanded, but most of all because the economy increasingly consists of services.\n",
      "142 Most state sales taxes exclude most services, and state lawmakers and voters have resisted efforts to tax services in part because many of the largest service categories (housing, medical care and education) can also be reasonably counted as life's necessities.\n",
      "143 ''It'd be nice if necessities weren't taxed, but necessity is subjective,'' says Joseph Henchman, who oversees state policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank that generally opposes sales tax exemptions.\n",
      "144 He notes that the nuanced arguments about what constitutes necessity have often led to very complicated sales tax rules.\n",
      "145 For example, the idea of exempting groceries from sales tax sounds simple enough, but most states want to continue collecting taxes on takeout and other prepared foods, on the grounds that having someone else cook for you is a luxury.\n",
      "146 As a result, they need to lay out rules explaining what is, and is not, a prepared food.\n",
      "147 So in 2010, Wisconsin's revenue department released a 1,400-word memo titled ''Sales of Ice Cream Cakes and Similar Items.''\n",
      "148 As the memo describes, sometimes an ice cream cake in Wisconsin is a tax-free baked good; in other cases, it's a taxable prepared food.\n",
      "149 The question hinges on several factors including the size of the cake, who decorated the cake, whether a majority of the cake's layers contain flour and whether the seller provides utensils along with the cake.\n",
      "150 A similar prepared-food question led to a minor political crisis in Britain in 2012.\n",
      "151 The government sought to simplify its rules on prepared food by declaring all foods sold above ambient room temperature, except freshly baked bread, to be subject to that country's 20 percent value-added tax.\n",
      "152 Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to withdraw the proposal over outrage that traditional English meat pies would be newly taxed, and so a complicated definition of ''prepared food'' remains.\n",
      "153 Complex definitions have also driven repeated changes in the taxation of tampons in at least one state.\n",
      "154 In 1990, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled tampons met that state's definition of a ''medical appliance'' and thus deserved a tax exemption then being withheld by the city of Chicago, but the state subsequently narrowed the exemption, and tampons are taxed at the full rate again.\n",
      "155 Unlike Illinois, most states restrict their tax exemptions for consumer medical products to prescription drugs.\n",
      "156 This may seem like an odd distinction (why does a prescription painkiller deserve better tax treatment than Advil?)\n",
      "157 but you can see why other states make it when you read Illinois' seven-page regulation setting out the new, tampon-exclusive definition of ''medication'' and ''medical appliance.''\n",
      "158 It turns out, it's surprisingly hard to define the place where toiletries end and medication begins.\n",
      "159 Unlike most states, Illinois needs a rule saying that medicated lip balm is not medication, and neither is dandruff shampoo -- not even the kind that smells like an industrial byproduct.\n",
      "160 The California bill proposed by Ms. Garcia, a Democrat, and Ling Ling Chang, a Republican colleague, avoids this ambiguity by simply creating an exemption for ''sanitary napkins and tampons,'' rather than a broad category of necessary medical or personal care products.\n",
      "161 Still, it would be added to a list of over 100 existing exemptions to the state's sales tax.\n",
      "162 Mr. Henchman noted one other reason to be wary of a tampon tax break: Sales taxes that exclude necessities and services tend to end up relying heavily on restaurant meals and durables like electronics and furniture, which are categories of spending that consumers cut back on when the economy weakens.\n",
      "163 This makes sales tax receipts more volatile, worsening the budget crises that arise in recessions.\n",
      "164 That is, one advantage of keeping the sales tax on tampons is that people will buy them whether the economy is good or bad -- which is more or less exactly the same reason to exempt them from tax in the first place.\n",

      "176 Legislators have done this to shield lower-income consumers from tax on the things they must buy in daily life —ike food.\n",
      "177 While 45 states collect a sales tax, only 13 of them charge it on groceries.\n",
      "178 Only one state —llinois —harges sales tax on prescription drugs.\n",
      "179 As Cristina Garcia, a state Assembly member, points out, tampons are pretty necessary.\n",
      "180 “ou can’ just ignore your period,”he said in a statement.\n",
      "181 So why shouldn’ tampons get the same tax break as other necessities?\n",
      "182 It’ a question that’ been debated in legislatures around the world, with tampon tax cutsadopted in Canada and rejected in France last year.\n",
      "183 Five states have already created tax exemptions for tampons.\n",
      "184 One, Pennsylvania, threw in a tax break for toilet paper and diapers, reasoning that these items also seemed pretty necessary.\n",
      "185 Individually, these exemptions make a lot of sense.\n",
      "186 But as arguments for tax exemptions have gotten sympathetic ears in state capitals over the decades, states’ales tax revenues have suffered.\n",
      "187 “egislatures always love to give the base away,”aid John Mikesell, an expert on sales taxes at the Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.\n",
      "188 By his calculations, the typical state sales tax is applied to just 36 percent of that state’ residents’ersonal income in 2012, down from nearly 60 percent in the late 1970s.\n",
      "189 That means the average American spends less than half of his or her income on items subject to sales tax.\n",
      "190 In California, the sales tax is already narrower than the national average, applying to just 27 percent of state residents’ncomes.\n",
      "191 Sales tax bases have shrunk over time partly because states have created new exemptions, partly because untaxed online sales have expanded, but most of all because the economy increasingly consists of services.\n",
      "192 Most state sales taxes exclude most services, and state lawmakers and voters have resisted efforts to tax services in part because many of the largest service categories (housing, medical care and education) can also be reasonably counted as life’ necessities.\n",
      "193 “t’ be nice if necessities weren’ taxed, but necessity is subjective,”ays Joseph Henchman, who oversees state policy for the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank that generally opposes sales tax exemptions.\n",
      "194 He notes that the nuanced arguments about what constitutes necessity have often led to very complicated sales tax rules.\n",
      "195 For example, the idea of exempting groceries from sales tax sounds simple enough, but most states want to continue collecting taxes on takeout and other prepared foods, on the grounds that having someone else cook for you is a luxury.\n",
      "196 As a result, they need to lay out rules explaining what is, and is not, a prepared food.\n",
      "197 So in 2010, Wisconsin’ revenue department released a 1,400-word memo titled “ales of Ice Cream Cakes and Similar Items.”s the memo describes, sometimes an ice cream cake in Wisconsin is a tax-free baked good; in other cases, it’ a taxable prepared food.\n",
      "198 The question hinges on several factors, including the size of the cake, who decorated the cake, whether a majority of the cake’ layers contain flour and whether the seller provides utensils along with the cake.\n",
      "199 A similar prepared-food question led to a minor political crisis in Britain in 2012.\n",
      "200 The government sought to simplify its rules on prepared food by declaring all foods sold above ambient room temperature, except freshly baked bread, to be subject to that country’ 20 percent value-added tax.\n",
      "201 Prime Minister David Cameron was forced to withdraw the proposal over outrage that traditional English meat pies would be newly taxed, and so a complicated definition of “repared food”emains.\n",
      "202 Complex definitions have also driven repeated changes in the taxation of tampons in at least one state.\n",
      "203 In 1990, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled tampons met that state’ definition of a “edical appliance”nd thus deserved a tax exemption then being withheld by the city of Chicago, but the state subsequently narrowed the exemption, and tampons are taxed at the full rate again.\n",
      "204 Unlike Illinois, most states restrict their tax exemptions for consumer medical products to prescription drugs.\n",
      "205 This may seem like an odd distinction (why does a prescription painkiller deserve better tax treatment than Advil?\n",
      "206 ), but you can see why other states make it when you read Illinois’ seven-page regulation setting out the new, tampon-exclusive definition of “edication”nd “edical appliance.”  It turns out, it’ surprisingly hard to define the place where toiletries end and medication begins.\n",
      "207 Unlike most states, Illinois needs a rule saying that medicated lip balm is not medication, and neither is dandruff shampoo —ot even the kind that smells like an industrial byproduct.\n",
      "208 The California bill proposed by Ms. Garcia, a Democrat, and Ling Ling Chang, a Republican colleague, avoids this ambiguity by simply creating an exemption for “anitary napkins and tampons,”ather than a broad category of necessary medical or personal care products.\n",
      "209 Still, it would be added to a list of over 100 existing exemptions to the state’ sales tax.\n",
      "210 Mr. Henchman noted one other reason to be wary of a tampon tax break: Sales taxes that exclude necessities and services tend to end up relying heavily on restaurant meals and durables like electronics and furniture, which are categories of spending that consumers cut back on when the economy weakens.\n",
      "211 This makes sales tax receipts more volatile, worsening the budget crises that arise in recessions.\n",
      "212 That is, one advantage of keeping the sales tax on tampons is that people will buy them whether the economy is good or bad —hich is more or less exactly the same reason to exempt them from tax in the first place.\n",

      "217 The so-called \"tampon tax,\" the issue Cristina Garcia now finds herself championing, isn't one she just stumbled upon; the alifornia assemblywoman said she has been thinking about this \"gender injustice\" for awhile.\n",
      "218 \"I think a lot of women have at some point, thought about it, you know?\"\n",
      "219 Garcia said this week.\n",
      "220 Last year, Garcia kicked around the idea of introducing legislation that would make feminine hygiene products exempt from sales taxes in America's most populous state.\n",
      "221 She didn't pull the trigger just then.\n",
      "222 ut at a meeting in October, she heard from women in her district, and they talked a lot about their daily struggles and \"how it all adds up,\" she said.\n",
      "223 On average, according to Garcia's office, women in California pay $7 per month for 40 years n taxes on tampons and sanitary napkins.\n",
      "224 Statewide, it adds up to ore than $20 million annually.\n",
      "225 These products, her office said, are a basic necessity\" that should not be taxed; it's especially \"unjust\" since the tax only impacts women who are already suffering on the wrong end of the gender wage gap.\n",
      "226 And so this week, on the irst day of California's 2016 legislative session, Garcia announced ssembly Bill 1561, which proposed an end o the tampon tax.\n",
      "227 \"I just want people to realize this is not insignificant,\" said Garcia, a Democrat.\n",
      "228 \"Especially if you're on a tight budget.\n",
      "229 \"And this is just the first step on a long discussion we need to be having,\" she added.\n",
      "230 Tampons (and similar products) are tax-exempt in only a handful of states, including Maryland and New Jersey.\n",
      "231 This map rom Fusion shows which states tax tampons and which ones don't:  Fusion's Taryn Hillin explained:  For those uninitiated in the country's tax codes (lucky you!\n",
      "232 ), most states tax all \"tangible personal property\" but make exemptions for select \"necessities\" (non-luxury items).\n",
      "233 Things that are considered necessities usually include groceries, food stamp purchases, medical purchases (prescriptions, prosthetics, some over-the-counter drugs), clothes (in some states), and agriculture supplies.\n",
      "234 The lists of exemptions vary from state to state.\n",
      "235 \"Basically we are being taxed for being women,\" Garcia said in announcing the bill.\n",
      "236 \"This is a step in the right direction to fix this gender injustice.\n",
      "237 Women have no choice but to buy these products, so the economic effect is only felt by woman [sic] and women of color are particularly hard hit by this tax.\n",
      "238 You can't just ignore your period, it's not like you can just ignore the constant flow.\"\n",
      "239 [Why you should always buy the men's version of almost anything]  It's an issue that's gaining more and more attention around the world.\n",
      "240 Canada's tax on feminine hygiene products was lifted over summer, after thousands signed an online petition on the matter.\n",
      "241 In Britain, a few women staged a \"tampon tax\" protest while on their periods ast fall.\n",
      "242 In California, Garcia jointly authored the new proposal with assemblywoman Ling Ling Chang, a Republican, who told The Post in a phone interview: \"Bottom line is, this bill is about tax relief for women.\"\n",
      "243 \"Government is taxing women for something that is totally out of their control,\" Chang said.\n",
      "244 \"Feminine hygiene is not a choice and should not be taxed.\"\n",
      "245 Chang has called the tax a form of \"regulatory discrimination.\"\n",
      "246 At this point, you might be trying to draw a comparison between a tampon and a product that is geared pecifically for men to use, like a condom.\n",
      "247 That's something that Chang said he'd oticed when reading the comments on tories about tampon taxes.\n",
      "248 Those comparisons don't hold up, Chang said.\n",
      "249 \"I was thinking …hat it's a biological function that women can't control,\" she said.\n",
      "250 \"Which makes it different.\n",
      "251 I can't really see any other product specifically for men that is comparable.\"\n",
      "252 \"I think it's because [as] people, we've been taught to hide this, not talk about it,\" said Garcia, when asked why so few states have otten rid of the tax.\n",
      "253 \"The reality is, these institutions of power are male-dominated.\n",
      "254 It's either they're not thinking about it, or they're afraid to approach it.\"\n",
      "255 Since the bill was introduced, Chang said, some men have told her that they've been waiting for a woman to carry the issue.\n",
      "256 That wasn't something she had heard before it was introduced, she said, but it didn't surprise her.\n",
      "257 \"Talk to some men and they get a little uncomfortable talking about feminine hygiene,\" she said.\n",
      "258 [Ban the bikini body]  The proposed legislation ould add tampons and sanitary napkins to the list of products that are exempt from sales tax in the state of California, if it passes.\n",

      "268 n a 2010 speech at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the president romised to increase NASA's budget by $6 billion over five years and said he hoped the United States would embark on a manned mission to Mars n the 2030s.\n",

      "273 But in perhaps the most surprising moment of the interview, Obama acknowledged he wasn't aware that tampons and sanitary napkins are taxed in the vast majority of states.\n",
      "274 Women who oppose the \"tampon tax\" say that they are being taxed for their periods.\n",
      "275 Obama did note, in fairness, that those taxes are levied at the state level, not the federal level.\n",
      "276 Responding to one of the most pressing questions of the past month, Obama weighed in on the now-famous \"dog pants\" controversy.\n",

      "305 Maybe this makes me a traitor to my sex, but I support the tampon tax.\n",
      "306 Mostly because it's not actually a tampon tax.\n",
      "307 For those unaware, \"tampon tax\" is shorthand for the fact that menstrual products are subject to sales taxes in most states, even though other products considered necessities (such as food and medicine) are often exempted.\n",
      "308 In recent months, this has spawned a legion of articles suggesting that squeamish, old, predominantly male politicians are punishing half of humanity for the crime of having a period.\n",
      "309 Some offer stories about poor women who say \"tampon taxes\" are cutting into money they desperately need for groceries or other bills.\n",
      "310 The issue has gained steam on the left, partly because it fits neatly into both the \"war on women\" and \"war on the poor\" narratives.\n",
      "311 Protests have erupted across the United States and abroad; bills have been introduced in state legislatures around the country, and a change.org petition gathered more than 40,000 signatures.\n",

      "317 I suspect it's because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.\"\n",
      "318 But the premise of this question, and of the broader \"tampon tax\" debate, is wrong-headed.\n",
      "319 First of all, it's highly misleading to call the taxes that tampons are subject to \"tampon taxes.\"\n",
      "320 To my knowledge, no jurisdiction has a tampon-specific tax, as it might an alcohol or yacht tax.\n",
      "321 Politicians didn't one day decide that periods were gross and therefore ought to be made more expensive.\n",
      "322 Instead, when states and cities needed revenue, they passed general sales taxes —hich happened to fall upon tampons along with countless other goods.\n",
      "323 Then, every interest group on earth came out of the woodwork demanding a carve-out on the grounds that their product or service was a \"necessity,\" just as anti-\"tampon tax\" activists have recently done.\n",
      "324 But what is a \"necessity,\" exactly?\n",
      "325 It's a pretty squishy term.\n",
      "326 Almost any product can be called necessary in modern times.\n",
      "327 And almost every product has.\n",
      "328 In California, the state where a \"tampon tax\" repeal bill has gotten the most press, such tax-favored purchases include: candy and bottled water, school yearbooks, certain commemorative lapel pins, hot prepared foods sold to airlines, farm equipment, garment alterations and racehorse breeding stock.\n",
      "329 The more things you exempt from sales taxes, of course, the higher the tax rates on other products have to rise to make up the lost revenue.\n",
      "330 That in turn increases the incentive for other interest groups to lobby for yet more exemptions, or find ways to disguise and recategorize their products to dodge taxes.\n",
      "331 (Is cold pizza a grocery item, and therefore a \"necessity,\" or a prepared food, and a luxury?)\n",
      "332 Which leads to more carve-outs for more \"necessities.\"\n",
      "333 Which leads to ever-higher tax rates.\n",
      "334 This vicious cycle is one reason tax experts generally caution against creating product-specific exemptions to consumption taxes.\n",
      "335 Very low tax rates, over a broad base of items, cause fewer distortions, in both what people buy and how many resources get devoted to repackaging and marketing existing products.\n",
      "336 Another reason to be skeptical about such exemptions is that they're poorly targeted.\n",
      "337 The most common rationale for exempting \"necessities\" —hether they be milk, Advil or, yes, tampons —s that such taxes especially hurt the poor.\n",
      "338 Low-income people, after all, spend a higher share of their incomes overall, and particularly more on \"necessities,\" however they're construed.\n",
      "339 But when you strip taxes from tampons or groceries, you relieve not just poor students and families from paying them.\n",
      "340 You're also giving a break to billionaires.\n",
      "341 A better way to address the regressivity of sales taxes is to just increase cash transfers to the poor —r to whichever group you think needs money the most.\n",
      "342 Maybe that's women, since they are more likely than men to buy menstrual products, though I'm skeptical of the idea that government is obligated to address every difference in every demographic group's consumption bundle.\n",
      "343 Maybe it seems unfair that in so many states Twizzlers don't get taxed while tampons do.\n",

      "348 NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- A bill in California calling for lawmakers to exempt tampons and sanitary pads from the state sales tax got a big endorsement this week from the board that administers the state's sales taxes.\n",
      "349 A few other states -- Utah, Virginia and New York -- have introduced similar bills.\n",
      "350 The issue of the \"tampon tax\" has gained prominence over the past year.\n",
      "351 Like groceries, a necessity of life that most states exempt from sales tax, tampons are also a necessity and likewise should be tax free, advocates say.\n",
      "352 \"[Menstruation] is a condition that happens every month for women.\n",
      "353 It's not a choice,\" said Fiona Ma, a CPA who sits on California's Board of Equalization that now supports making tampons tax-free.\n",
      "354 Some say the tax unfairly adds to the economic burden of women, who studies suggest may get paid less than men in comparable positions and may be charged higher prices for similar items and services.\n",
      "355 Others suspect that taxing tampons is just another example of gender bias.\n",
      "356 Even President Obama seems to subscribe to that theory.\n",
      "357 When asked in a recent interview if he felt it was right that tampons are taxed, he said, \"I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items.\n",
      "358 I suspect it's because men were making the laws when these were passed.\"\n",
      "359 But those arguments ignore the reality of how U.S. state sales tax laws work.\n",
      "360 For starters, there are many \"necessities\" (including most personal hygiene products) that are subject to state sales taxes in most of the 45 states that impose them.\n",
      "361 \"We tax toilet paper.\n",
      "362 We tax soap.\n",
      "363 We tax most things.\n",
      "364 I don't think this is a plot to burden women,\" said Kim Rueben, a state and local public financing senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\n",
      "365 That's because sales tax statutes typically just say that all goods are subject to tax, and then list only the exemptions that lawmakers have intentionally carved out for any number of reasons.\n",
      "366 A big one is the idea that the poor shouldn't have to pay tax on things they must buy to survive.\n",
      "367 But exempting an item gives a tax break to everyone else who buys it as well.\n",
      "368 In an ideal tax system, policy experts say, everything would be subject to a very low sales tax rate.\n",
      "369 Then to make sure the poor aren't harmed, they could be given an advance tax credit or rebate to cover their sales tax burden.\n",
      "370 Sales taxes are inconsistent: Decisions about what is and isn't subject to state sales taxes are often highly subjective, if not plain \"goofy\" as Tax Analysts deputy publisher David Brunori put it.\n",
      "371 Food may be a necessity, but not all types of food are tax exempt.\n",
      "372 Unsalted nuts may be, but salted ones might not be.\n",

      "393 Ms Sherriff said research shows on average women's products can be 37% more expensive than similar products for men and \"that goes right across the board\", not just on items like toiletries but on many different products and services like dry cleaning, children's toys and even hair cuts.\n",
      "394 \"If a man and a woman with short hair go in to a hairdresser often they are charged completely different rates simply based on gender,\" she said.\n",

      "396 When asked by the Press Association if she believes that on gender pricing, women are being treated like second-class citizens, she said: \"I think there are times when that is happening.\n",
      "397 \"I think that is partly why I have called for this debate.\"\n",
      "398 Ms Sherriff said she felt \"very, very frustrated\" when the problem first came to light.\n",

      "529 But while it appears to cut taxes, it could actually do the opposite, said Billy Hesterman with the Utah Taxpayers Association.\n",
      "530 Eliminating the tax might mean lawmakers would raise the overall tax rate.\n",

      "598 Here's a rundown of where some of the major issues stand:  ccc  Medical marijuana - The Senate passed two bills on the issue and sent them for House consideration.\n",
      "599 Despite opposition by the LDS Church, the Senate passed SB73 by Sen. Mark Madsen on a 17-12 vote ccc which includes allowing products with THC, the psychoactive drug in marijuana.\n",
      "600 Madsen made a series of concessions to address concerns by the church and lawmakers.\n",
      "601 He removed language to allow patients to access the raw flower or bud of the marijuana plant because of fears patients would smoke it.\n",
      "602 He added language to require the products to be clearly labeled and sealed in child-proof containers, and added a buffer around schools and churches where marijuana dispensaries and growth facilities could not be located.\n",
      "603 And he removed language that would prevent cities from blocking the facilities through zoning ordinances.\n",

      "605 This more incremental approach would allow the use of cannabidiol extracts from marijuana plants that do not contain THC for treatment of such ailments as epilepsy.\n",
      "606 The list of ailments for legal use would be smaller than the other bill and there would be no access for children, as allowed by the other bill.\n",
      "607 The LDS Church has not opposed that bill, and it is expected to have a greater chance of final passage in the Legislature where more than 80 percent of members are LDS.\n",
      "608 ccc  Medicaid expansion - The House likely will be the major battlefield for health care coverage for the uninsured as it is expected to consider HB437 by House Majority Leader Jim Dunnigan, R- Taylorsville.\n",
      "609 It aims to help 16,000 of the poorest Utahns who are uninsured ccc focusing on those who are chronically homeless, parolees or those in need of treatment for substance abuse or mental illness.\n",
      "610 The $100 million price tag ccc $30 million in state funds and $70 million in federal money ccc would translate into health benefits for a little more than a third of the 43,000 Utah adults who are uninsured and living below the poverty level.\n",
      "611 Last year, the Senate passed a much more generous plan proposed by Gov.\n",
      "612 Gary Herbert, but the House blocked it.\n",
      "613 It would have cost the state about $78 million to subsidize health coverage to about 125,000 individual Utahns annually earning up to $16,243, or 138 percent of the federal poverty level.\n",
      "614 Because of House obstacles last year, Niederhauser said the Senate is content to wait for the House to present a plan.\n",
      "615 Still, a Senate committee approved a bill by Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, to fully expand Medicaid, and debate on it by the full Senate is pending.\n",
      "616 That bill would cost the state an estimated $50 million in 2020, while bringing in hundreds of millions of federal dollars.\n",
      "617 Gov.\n",
      "618 Herbert told reporters this week that the Dunnigan bill may be the best that is politically possible.\n",
      "619 ccc  Hate crimes - Again, despite opposition by the LDS Church, the Senate gave preliminary approval to SB107 to better protect groups, including LGBT people, from bias-motivated crimes.\n",
      "620 The LDS Church had opposed it as upsetting the balance between gay rights and religious liberty achieved through the historic Utah compromise legislation in 2015.\n",
      "621 It passed 17-12 on the initial Senate vote, and four senators warned they could change their votes from yes to no unless changes are made ccc so its future is cloudy.\n",
      "622 ccc  Death penalty - A Senate committee has endorsed SB189 to eliminate the death penalty in Utah, and the full Senate will consider it next.\n",
      "623 Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, its sponsor, said reasons to eliminate the death sentence include the high costs of prosecution and appeals, the failure of the punishment to serve as a deterrent to crime, the wrongful convictions and executions of some, and the decades of pain that victims' families suffer waiting for executions to occur.\n",
      "624 Public opinion polls show most Utahns support the death penalty, and SB189 is expected to face stiff opposition from lawmakers and groups that argue that capital punishment is the fitting penalty for some crimes.\n",
      "625 ccc  Online sales tax - Two separate bills, SB182 and HB235, have been endorsed by committees to help the state collect sales tax for online purchases.\n",
      "626 Currently, merchants selling products online must collect tax only if they have a physical location ccc such as a store or warehouse ccc within the state where the purchase is made.\n",
      "627 Even when tax is not automatically collected, Utah buyers still now technically owe it ccc and are supposed to include it in their annual income-tax returns.\n",
      "628 Utah collects only about $200,000 a year, out of an estimated $80 million to $350 million owed.\n",
      "629 The bills would require more online businesses to collect, but they are opposed by numerous conservative and business groups.\n",
      "630 Critics contend the legislation amounts to taxation without representation for out-of-state businesses and a tax hike for Utah residents.\n",
      "631 ccc  Transportation vs. water - Another big fight continues over whether to spend about a half-billion dollars over the next 11 years on transportation or water projects.\n",
      "632 The Senate has passed SB80 to transfer about $36 million a year from the transportation fund to water projects, such as the controversial Lake Powell pipeline and dams to develop Bear River water.\n",
      "633 Many critics would rather leave the money in transportation, noting it would take $473 million over the next 11 years ccc and delay such projects as converting Bangerter Highway into a freeway and completing the Mountain View Corridor freeway.\n",
      "634 Herbert had proposed to shift a similar amount of money from transportation to education, but lawmakers torpedoed that idea.\n",
      "635 ccc  Pollution - The Senate is expected to vote soon on SB102 to give oil refineries some huge state tax credits to upgrade to cleaner \"Tier 3\" fuels ccc and credits are bigger if they move more quickly.\n",
      "636 Okerlund is sponsor of the bill and said it would offer tax credits over several years totaling up to 50 percent of the cost of upgrading refineries to produce the cleaner Tier 3 fuels.\n",
      "637 He said such upgrades often will cost oil companies $100 million or more.\n",
      "638 The bill offers tax credits of 50 percent of the upgrade costs for refineries that make the conversion before 2020, 48 percent if it is made before 2021, 45 percent if made before 2022, 40 percent if before 2023, 35 percent before 2024, and 30 percent before 2025.\n",
      "639 While Okerlund says it will cut tailpipe emissions in Utah by 80 percent, opponents say it amounts to oil companies trying to hold Utah hostage for tax credits to clean the air.\n",
      "640 ccc  Abortion - Rep. Curt Oda, R-Clearfield, introduced HB442 to ban most abortions, but the Legislature's lawyers warn that it is likely unconstitutional.\n",
      "641 The bill seeks to abolish what it calls \"dismemberment abortion,\" and would ban several procedures that are common in first-trimester abortions.\n",
      "642 It has yet to be scheduled for a hearing.\n",
      "643 Sen. Curt Bramble, R-Provo, has introduced SB234, requiring doctors before an abortion to administer anesthesia to fetuses after the 20th week of gestation, regardless of consent of the mother.\n",
      "644 The measure, which is up for its first hearing Monday morning, claims substantial medical evidence exists that fetuses feel pain, although that is hotly disputed by experts.\n",
      "645 ccc  Smaller but interesting - One bill is advancing that would add a 10-cent fee on single-use paper and plastic bags, seeking to encourage use of reusable bags for groceries.\n",
      "646 A Senate committee approved SB196 on a close 3-2 vote.\n",
      "647 It now goes to the full Senate.\n",
      "648 Another bill is advancing to end a long war over the future of the Utah State Fairpark.\n",
      "649 A Senate Committee approved SB173 to keep the fairgrounds at its present site, and allows a variety of reforms to help it make money from events other than the fair.\n",
      "650 ccc  Different ideas - The Senate passed a resolution calling for Congress to repeal the 17th amendment that allows voters to elect U.S. senators.\n",
      "651 It wants to select senators instead, saying that would make them represent state governments.\n",
      "652 It now goes to the House.\n",
      "653 The Senate passed a bill designed to crack down on an infamous \"speed trap\" in Mantua in Box Elder County.\n",
      "654 That town now generates 39 percent of city revenues from speeding tickets.\n",

      "656 It also is now pending in the House.\n",
      "657 The Senate also has passed and sent to the House SCR9 to declare pornography as a public health care crisis.\n",
      "658 ccc  Dead proposals - Several ideas have been voted down this year and appear dead ccc although bills sometimes are resurrected.\n",
      "659 Among those apparently done for the year are a \"death with dignity\" bill allowing terminal patients to receive life-ending prescriptions; a plan to remove the \"Zion Curtain,\" 7-foot barriers to prevent children from seeing the mixing of drinks at restaurant bars; and one to stop the \"tampon tax\" on feminine hygiene products and diapers.\n",
      "660 Also dead is a proposal to raise income tax on the richest 1.5 percent of Utahns to better fund education, and a companion proposal also to raise sale tax by a penny per dollar for education.\n",

      "780 NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state's \"tampon tax\" reflects a double standard that applies the sales tax to menstrual products used by women while exempting items typically used by men, such as Rogaine and condoms, according to a class-action lawsuit filed on Thursday.\n",
      "781 \"It's a tax on women for being women.\n",
      "782 And that's wrong,\" said Ilann Maazel, a lawyer representing the five women who filed the class action in state Supreme Court in Manhattan.\n",
      "783 New York is one of 40 states that levy a sales tax on feminine sanitary products, and Maazel said he hoped suing the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance would trigger a national rollback of what he said are illegal taxes.\n",
      "784 The five women who filed the lawsuit include an actor, photographer, law school professor, church program coordinator and data scientist.\n",
      "785 The lawsuit seeks to end the tax and to refund money to the estimated 5 million women who purchase menstrual products in the state.\n",
      "786 The 4 percent state sales tax applied to tampons, sanitary napkins and other products used by women during their monthly menstrual cycle amounts to $14 million a year in New York, Maazel said.\n",
      "787 Menstrual products should be included on the list of items exempt from the sales tax because they are deemed necessary to human health.\n",
      "788 That exemption is already granted to Rogaine, condoms, foot powder, dandruff shampoo, acne soap, incontinence pads and other items, the lawsuit said.\n",
      "789 \"These are not luxury items, but a necessity for women's health,\" the lawsuit said.\n",
      "790 Women spend an average of $70 each year on tampons and pad, according to the lawsuit.\n",
      "791 \"Without access to tampons and sanitary pads, women are forced to use unsanitary and dirty rags —hich can lead to infections and an increased risk of diseases such as cervical cancer —r have nothing at all to staunch the blood —hich poses a risk to the health of women and the public,\" the suit says.\n",

      "843 Before you brush me off as cheap or overdramatic, consider this: Gender-based pricing means women pay on average $1,351 more per year for the same products than men do.\n",

      "848 You could take a page out of my book and replace some of your more expensive female-focused products with a men's equivalent, or stop buying clothes that require dry cleaning.\n",
      "849 But one thing women can't change, period, is -- well -- their period.\n",
      "850 This monthly event requires that we buy products, like tampons and sanitary pads, for which there is no cheaper male equivalent.\n",
      "851 We can't exactly decide to stop buying them and continue like it's business as usual while our bodies ruin our dry-clean-only pants.\n",
      "852 But in most states, these products come with a sales tax.\n",
      "853 That may seem perfectly acceptable, considering most of us expect a sales tax when we shop and don't look too closely at our state tax codes.\n",
      "854 But state governments frequently exempt many \"necessary\" goods from sales tax, like prescription drugs, some over-the-counter medicines, and groceries.\n",
      "855 Even products like Chapstick and incontinence pads are often tax exempt.\n",
      "856 But only five states -- Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and New Jersey --- have chosen not to tax tampons.\n",
      "857 Apparently, state governments have a hard time believing that tampons are a necessity.\n",
      "858 I have a hard time believing this idiocy.\n",
      "859 The issue has spurred a campaign to eliminate the \"tampon tax\" and it has been gaining ground across the country and beyond.\n",
      "860 In California, Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia has proposed a bill to exempt tampons from sales tax.\n",
      "861 Meanwhile, Canada has already eliminated the unfair practice.\n",
      "862 This week, five women in New York decided to stand up for Aunt Flo and filed a lawsuit against the state to end the tax on tampons and other essential products like sanitary pads.\n",
      "863 Women spend about $70 per year on tampons and sanitary pads.\n",
      "864 Multiply that by about 40 years, add it to the increased price on many other products and services, and suddenly being a woman is costing a whole lot.\n",
      "865 For low-income women, access to these \"luxury\" goods can be a real challenge, especially since food stamps don't cover feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "866 But this goes beyond the dollar amount.\n",
      "867 This is institutional and systematic sexism.\n",
      "868 It's harming women financially and reflecting a deeper sentiment regarding (or disregarding) women's bodies.\n",
      "869 The New York State Department of Taxes and Finance says \"feminine hygiene\" products like tampons and sanitary napkins are subject to sales tax because they are \"generally used to control a normal bodily function and to maintain personal cleanliness.\"\n",

      "875 Periods are biological functions that occur regularly for decades and are completely out of women's control.\n",
      "876 Because we're talking about products that are necessary for women to be healthy productive humans, discriminatory pricing is unacceptable.\n",
      "877 The practice has echoes of biblical depictions of women being sequestered in \"red tents\" during their time of the month.\n",
      "878 If state governments can deem products like foot powder, dandruff shampoo, and Rogaine tax-exempt as \"nonluxury\" goods, I don't see any reason they shouldn't do the same for tampons.\n",

      "1340 OLYMPIA - Amid a national discussion on the fairness of taxing feminine hygiene products, two proposals to end that \"tampon tax\" in Washington didn't get a hearing this year.\n",
      "1341 Proposals to eliminate the state's sales tax on feminine hygiene products would have saved consumers $4.6 million next year, an official estimate says.\n",
      "1342 Both bills - one in the House and one in the Senate - were referred to committees that study tax and budget issues, but neither received a hearing.\n",
      "1343 Republican Sen. Joe Fain, of Auburn, proposed a sales tax exemption on feminine hygiene products that had bipartisan co- sponsors.\n",
      "1344 While he disagrees with many complaints about Washington's sales tax as being regressive, in this case, he thinks it's true.\n",
      "1345 \"I kept hearing about this as 'the luxury tax' on tampons,\" he said.\n",
      "1346 \"It's not a luxury tax, it's just a sales tax.\n",
      "1347 It's not something people can choose to purchase, it's an absolute necessity that they purchase.\"\n",
      "1348 Rep. Lynda Wilson, R-Vancouver, said she was aware of the national movement to eliminate the tax, did some rough calculations and concluded the average woman pays about $350 in taxes for feminine hygiene products over her childbearing years.\n",
      "1349 That amount seemed small enough for individual taxpayers that she tried redirecting the money rather than ending the tax.\n",
      "1350 In January, she proposed using it on domestic violence programs, an issue that predominately affects women.\n",
      "1351 When that bill didn't get a hearing, she proposed another bill in mid-February to eliminate the sales tax on those products.\n",
      "1352 \"I believed if I couldn't get bipartisan support for re- appropriating the taxes, then we should aim to eliminate them since these products are medically necessary for women,\" Wilson said in an email.\n",
      "1353 Although the bills didn't get hearings, the Department of Revenue estimated how much sales tax revenue comes into the state general fund from those products.\n",
      "1354 It calculated about $4.6 million per year for the next three years, and $5.5 million a year after that.\n",
      "1355 With the Legislature in a special session trying to develop a balanced budget, the tax-exemption bills in the Senate are presumed dead.\n",
      "1356 That's because the $4.6 million they would save consumers would be money the state's general fund didn't get, and could have to be replaced by other means.\n",
      "1357 Fain said the state should take a comprehensive look at the possibility of exempting these products and other necessities, such as diapers and children's school supplies, from the sales tax to help young families.\n",
      "1358 But that's not usually a topic for a supplemental budget, he added.\n",
      "1359 \"We need to to move from (the tampon tax) being a whimsical thing to a serious conversation about lessening the tax burden on necessary things,\" Fain said.\n",
      "1360 \"I'll introduce the bill again next session.\"\n",
      "1361 The national push to eliminate sales tax on feminine hygiene products has generated an online petition backed by Cosmopolitan magazine, led seven states to consider legislation and prompted a lawsuit in New York challenging that state's tax, the Associated Press reported recently.\n",
      "1362 Five states do not tax those products.\n",
      "1363 The lawsuit in New York contends the tax on feminine hygiene products is unconstitutional when some other products used by both genders, such as lip balm, foot powder and dandruff shampoo, are not taxed.\n",
      "1364 In Washington, however, there is no difference in the tax rate between those items and feminine hygiene products.\n",

      "1537 “his is a product that women will use over and over again throughout the course of their lives and have this long exposure to this really sensitive part of their body.”t just didn’ seem like a great idea for a woman to use something that may contain traces of pesticides month after month and decade after decade, Hayward says.\n",
      "1538 Despite the proliferation of this niche market for organic menstrual products, there is still very little research to support the personal health need for organic all-cotton tampons.\n",
      "1539 Just as there is minimal independent research to support the long term safety of conventional rayon tampons or those made of composite materials, all of which dominate feminine product aisles across the country.\n",
      "1540 The majority of research showing that tampons made from synthetic materials are safe for women has been funded by, or is in some way affiliated with, tampon manufacturers like Procter and Gamble and Johnson & Johnson.\n",
      "1541 Sales of tampons, pads and other menstrual products totaled $3.1bn in the US in 2015, according to market research group Euromonitor.\n",
      "1542 Even Hayward admits the question of whether organic tampons are healthier has not been adequately scientifically proven.\n",
      "1543 “here is the concern for this, where is the research, where is the public knowledge?”  Related: California lawmakers introduce bill that would eliminate 'tampon tax'  In fact, a team of researchers at the Helfgott Research Institute at the National College of Natural Medicine in Portland, Oregon, attempted to quantify the pros and cons of organic cotton versus rayon tampons over four months between 2011 and 2012.\n",
      "1544 One of the principal investigators, Carolyn Nygaard, a naturopathic physician, says the study compared three types of cytokines –mall proteins that indicate vaginal inflammation.\n",
      "1545 In analyzing the results, the team realized the study’ sample size of 20 was too small, the results were not statistically significant, and there was very little difference in the cytokine levels from one tampon type to the other.\n",
      "1546 The research was never published.\n",
      "1547 Although the study, which was funded by a manufacturer of organic cotton tampons, couldn’ prove that any single tampon material is preferable from an irritation standpoint, it did provide an unexpected bit of information: it showed evidence that insertion of anything causes inflammation.\n",
      "1548 That is, all types of tampons provoke an inflammatory response in the vagina.\n",
      "1549 However, Philip Tierno, professor of microbiology and pathology at the New York University School of Medicine, says the choice of whether to use synthetic or all-cotton tampons is clear cut.\n",
      "1550 Tierno has conducted some of the most significant research on Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) over the last 30 years.\n",
      "1551 TSS associated with tampons is caused by the bacterial toxin Staphylococcus aureus and can lead to death or amputation of limbs.\n",
      "1552 Tierno’ research on tampons and TSS has only isolated the Staph bacteria from rayon tampons, never cotton ones.\n",
      "1553 “here is no doubt that cotton tampons are the safest, providing the least risk as far as Toxic Shock is concerned,”ierno says.\n",
      "1554 In addition to concerns about bacteria and pesticide residues, which are linked to endocrine-disruption and cancer, many women who use tampons are also worried about dioxins, bacteria, allergens, fragrances, and parabens (preservatives).\n",
      "1555 Related: Tampon tax to be scrapped, announces Osborne  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which classifies tampons as a medical device, says the bleaching methods for rayon tampons that left trace amounts of dioxin in the products “ears ago”s no longer in use.\n",
      "1556 Tampon manufacturers must now conduct their own dioxin tests and report these to the FDA.\n",

      "1558 That’ because although dioxin levels may be below detection levels in each tampon, the problem, according to Nygaard, is that “omen wear 16 to 20 tampons per cycle, 13 cycles per year” “omen menstruate for 30 to 40 years,”he says.\n",
      "1559 “o there is the potential to have cumulative effects from that.”ne reason many women worry specifically about menstrual products is that the vaginal membrane has been shown to be more absorptive of medicine and other materials than external skin.\n",

      "1561 “f you have things [such as dioxins and pesticides] that are present in tampons, they can be cumulative over time.”  Alexandra Scranton, director of science and research at Women’ Voices for the Earth, a Montana-based advocacy group that promotes the elimination of “oxic chemicals” points out that conventional tampon manufacturers do not specify on their packaging whether they use preservatives or what types of fragrances they use.\n",
      "1562 There is also no research readily available on how the polyethylene, polypropylene and polyester in tampons, such as those from Tampax, may affect women’ bodies when used internally over time.\n",
      "1563 “e’ really like to see better disclosure of ingredients,”cranton says.\n",

      "1565 Hesitation to insert a product of unknown composition and origin may be one reason companies like Thinx, which sells underwear that purports to absorb two tampons’orth of liquid, are also popping up.\n",
      "1566 But even Thinx uses antimicrobial cotton –ade antimicrobial by an undisclosed process –or its interior layer, and doesn’ specify the makeup of “ll the other technology” between that layer of cotton and the nylon/spandex exterior.\n",

      "1687 Last-minute attack ads against John Kasich are part of an effort to run the table.\n",
      "1688 Delegates are apportioned by congressional districts, and there are one or two (of eight total) where the Texan believes he's within the margin of error with Trump.\n",

      "1696 The 102 percent numbers came from a Wall Street Journal story, with more nuance than Kasich offered.\n",
      "1697 The Journal also said Trump needs to get 66 percent of the remaining bound delegates left to be awarded, which will become a heavier lift after Wisconsin.\n",
      "1698 \"Cruz has been awarded 463 delegates and must take 102 percent of remaining bound delegates to reach 1,237,\" Reid Epstein writes in the Journal, \"though his campaign believes its total is higher because of private commitments made by unbound delegates and delegates now tied to candidates who have suspended their campaigns.\"\n",
      "1699 -- There are other counts that show Cruz could technically still win outright, but it's hard to imagine anyone pulling away decisively with the race as muddied as it has become:  \"The hope of putting Cruz out of outright contention for the first ballot comes in New York, where 95 delegates wait to be assigned, and an average of polls collected by RealClearPolitics puts Trump 32 points ahead of the field,\" David Weigel, who is traveling with Kasich, explains.\n",

      "1702 * Trump thinks the Ohio governor could siphon off enough delegates to prevent him from securing the nomination.\n",

      "1713 This could make him a much more consequential player during the three months leading up to the convention.\n",

      "1948 Making menstrual products tax-exempt has become an activist priority in the last year  New York is on track to become the 11th U.S. state to drop the sales tax on menstrual products, with both houses of the state’ legislature passing versions of a bill that would put an end to the “tampon tax.”  Women are believed to spend up to $20 a year on the tampon tax, so the new law—hich NY Gov.\n",
      "1949 Andrew Cuomo has previously indicated support for—ould mean up to about $800 in savings on sales tax alone for the average New York woman over her lifetime.\n",
      "1950 “ew York is leading the way in the fight for menstrual equity in the U.S.,”aid Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, vice president at the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonprofit based at New York University School of Law.\n",
      "1951 For Weiss-Wolf and her fellow activists, the activity in New York is “remendous”ut also just the first step, with 39 states remaining in which consumers pay taxes on tampons and pads but not on adult diapers, prescription drugs such as Viagra, Rogaine or even candy bars in vending machines, which are among the products deemed “edical necessities”nd thus, tax-exempt.\n",
      "1952 The dollar savings for women won’ exactly knock your Thinx off, activists say, but that’ not what it’ about, exactly.\n",
      "1953 “rom the perspective of women who already earn less and pay more as a result of their gender, paying this sales tax is a burden we should not have to shoulder,”aid Weiss-Wolf.\n",

      "1956 It has also gone international, with France cutting the sales tax in late 2015 and the European Union taking a stance on the issue this year.\n",
      "1957 Women have even taken the tax to court: Earlier this month, a group brought a class-action suit against New York to the tune of $28 million dollars, a calculation of less than $3 per person a year in sales tax.\n",
      "1958 But the tax’ cost to any one woman varies widely based on the person, amount and type of menstrual product used and, of course, a state’ sales tax.\n",
      "1959 (Weiss-Wolf’ calculation is about $8 of tampon tax a year per woman, which assumes women spend between $70 and $100 a year on menstrual products.\n",
      "1960 If a woman spends between $100 and $225 on such products, as the Diva Cup—hich manufactures an alternative menstrual product—stimates, she could relinquish up to $16 a year to the tampon tax.)\n",
      "1961 But in any case, it adds up: Assuming no interruptions, women spend about 40 years of their lives buying menstrual products.\n",
      "1962 That translates to an up to $800 spend over the course of women’ lives on sales tax on period products alone.\n",

      "2070 It makes little to no difference that any money they make, unlike a spouse's income, is not part of your own community property, doesn't bolster your own bank account.\n",

      "2074 That's precisely why it's important to ensure that those we choose to be our political leaders, whether by election or appointment, are never put in the position of being able to put their own children's or other close relative's monetary interests over people with whom they are not related.\n",
      "2075 No one —ot even a politician —an be blamed for choosing to do so.\n",

      "2080 That rather large loophole is what caused state Sen. Tony Mendoza, D-Artesia, to author legislation that would add the adult children, siblings, parents of officials, and their spouses, to the list of people who would cause a conflict of interest to occur and force officials to recuse themselves from voting or acting on contracts and other action that would be of material benefit.\n",
      "2081 Mendoza told the Los Angeles Times that he has wanted to push for expansion of the conflict regulations ever since he was on the Artesia City Council and saw another council member vote to approve a contract for a firm owned by that member's father.\n",
      "2082 Violation by public officials in California of the senator's proposed legislation, SB 330, would result in disqualification from ever holding any office in California, prison time and/or a fine of not more than $1,000.\n",
      "2083 It passed out of the state Senate last week and is headed for the Assembly, which should pass it, and then the governor, who should sign it.\n",
      "2084 \"If other states in our nation and private corporations already provide this level of protection against self-dealing, Californians deserve no less,\" Mendoza has said.\n",
      "2085 He's got that right, though the law may not go far enough.\n",
      "2086 In both Arizona and the District of Columbia, for instance, conflict laws address more deeply financial decisions that would cause an official's loyalty to be divided.\n",
      "2087 Arizona's conflict-of interest law goes beyond the immediate family to include close friends, and the D.C. law covers members of the public officeholder's household, regardless of family ties.\n",

      "2095 The legislation was the result of negotiations between the Brown administration and union leaders who were backing initiatives that would've placed the issue in the hands of state voters this November.\n",
      "2096 Specifically, the deal will raise California's minimum wage to $10.50 this coming Jan. 1; $11.00 on Jan. 1, 2018; and then add $1 each subsequent Jan. 1, topping out at $15 per hour in 2022. Business with 25 or fewer workers will have an additional year to implement each of those bumps.\n",
      "2097 The negotiated deal is better for the state than the fall ballot initiatives that were being pressed by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers (SEIU-UHW) and California's state council of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n",
      "2098 Under the measure signed into law, the governor can choose to \"pause\" a scheduled increase for one year under certain conditions - seasonally adjusted statewide job growth is negative for the prior 3 or 6 months and retail sales receipts for the prior 12 months is negative.\n",
      "2099 Another option for a pause by the governor can be triggered if any year from the current budget year to two additional years is forecasted to be in deficit when including the next scheduled increase.\n",
      "2100 This trigger can only be used twice under the law.\n",
      "2101 This flexibility will allow California's governor to monitor the situation and ease back on the increases if the state economy heads south.\n",
      "2102 In addition, since the Legislature drafted the $15 minimum wage law it can tweak it down the road if trouble signs appear.\n",
      "2103 This is important because while many parts of the nation have already adopted minimum wages higher than the current $7.25 an hour federal minimum that has been in place since 2009 —ncluding New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles which are on their own tracks to reach $15 an hour —alifornia is in uncharted waters with its plan to put the entire state under a $15 minimum.\n",
      "2104 While there have been conflicting studies on how minimum wage increases affect the economy, no state has enacted an across-the-board, 50 percent increase like this one.\n",
      "2105 The $15 minimum under full implementation by 2023 likely will still exceed the federal poverty level, which in 2016 for a family of four is $24,300; $15 per hour brings a full-time worker $31,200 per year.\n",
      "2106 The governor's office says that currently almost 2.2 million of the state's 7 million hourly workers are paid minimum wage.\n",
      "2107 While $15 an hour might seem completely reasonable, or even paltry, in a high-cost city like San Francisco or Los Angeles, a 50 percent wage boost could indeed prove unsustainable for employers in other areas, like Imperial County of the Central Valley, where the cost of living is much lower.\n",

      "2119 Sen. Hannah-Beth Jackson, D-Santa Barbara, introduced the bill, SB 900, in response to persistent seepage of oil that forced the closure of Summerland Beach between here and Santa Barbara.\n",
      "2120 It was believed to come from an 1890s well abandoned long before the state established any true regulatory oversight of the industry.\n",
      "2121 The well has been leaking for decades.\n",
      "2122 That beach has been closed several times in recent years because the oil seepage has created a public health hazard.\n",

      "2124 A cursory estimate places at 200 the number of similarly abandoned wells, with the majority along Summerland and Ellwood beaches in Santa Barbara County and along the Central Coast.\n",
      "2125 Sen. Jackson has introduced legislation that, with its recent amendments, creates a clearly defined and clearly funded path for the State Lands Commission to plug those wells and also clean up other abandoned structures along the coast, ranging from piers and pilings to jetties and sea walls.\n",
      "2126 The first step is to identify the problem.\n",
      "2127 Jackson's bill gives the Lands Commission two years to conduct an inventory to establish the extent of the problem and create a plan for capping the wells and disposing of existing hazards.\n",
      "2128 It gives the commission a maximum of $2 million a year to do the job.\n",
      "2129 Although the money would come from the state general fund, the commission currently deposits all the revenue it receives from mineral and oil leases on the states's coastal and tideland areas into the general fund.\n",
      "2130 The legislation would allow the state to keep funding the cleanup up to a ceiling of $2 million a year.\n",
      "2131 As it is estimated that capping just one well could cost up to $1 million, we understand this funding may not be sufficient to totally solve the problem.\n",
      "2132 But the methodical approach taken in the legislation allows the state to, first, identify the problem; second, create a plan; and then start to tackle it based on the areas of greatest danger.\n",
      "2133 It's a reasonable approach that will allow us to consider additional funding in the future, if there is sufficient need and support.\n",

      "2290 \"There is something uniquely taboo about menstruation, much stronger than norms around reproduction or women's bodies,\" Chris Bobel, an associate professor of women's studies at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and the president of the Society for Menstrual Research, said in a phone interview.\n",
      "2291 \"We have a very uncomfortable relationship with women's bodies, and we see menstruation as a problem that needs to be hidden or fixed,\" said Bobel, who is also the author of \"New Blood: Third-Wave Feminism and the Politics of Menstruation.\"\n",
      "2292 This, she and some of her fellow scholars maintain, leads to poor body image and self-esteem issues.\n",
      "2293 Bobel told me that although a body of scholarship related to menstruation has been around for decades (the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research has existed since 1977), it's been considered a fringe topic.\n",
      "2294 These days, though, menstruation is enjoying a bit of a moment.\n",
      "2295 Things like what is sometimes called the \"tampon tax\" on feminine hygiene products means that we are finally talking about menstruation and menstrual products in a larger, public sphere.\n",
      "2296 So, without further ado, here are 11 notable items from the Museum of Menstruation.\n",
      "2297 Homemade reusable pad (probably Italian, probably from the late 19th or early 20th century)  Once, women fashioned their own products such as these cloth pads, which were meant to be washed and used again and again.\n",
      "2298 The first commercially available disposable pads in the United States were made by Johnson & Johnson in 1896, but they were not popular because they could not be advertised.\n",
      "2299 The product was eventually discontinued.\n",
      "2300 Fax tampons  Homemade tampons have been around for centuries.\n",
      "2301 Fax tampons were some of the first commercially marketed tampons, probably from the late 1920s or early 1930s.\n",
      "2302 These beauties were made of an absorbent material wrapped in gauze; they had no applicator and no string.\n",
      "2303 Packaging information reminds readers that using a Fax tampon does not interfere with urination, as there are indeed separate orifices for menstruation and urination, and tampons are appropriate for \"young or unmarried girls.\"\n",
      "2304 Laugh if you will, but Bobel told me that the concern about whether internal menstrual products might damage or perforate the hymen (and thereby compromise virginity) continues to exist.\n",
      "2305 Wampole’ Vaginal Cones  The Henry K. Wampole company marketed a few varieties of \"vaginal cones\" as a curative for infection, including sexually transmitted maladies such as gonorrhea.\n",
      "2306 One of the product's ingredients, sodium borate, remains in use today; you might know it better as 20 Mule Team Borax, a laundry detergent.\n",
      "2307 Picric acid, another ingredient, can be explosive; during World War I, it was used in artillery shells.\n",
      "2308 Menstrual (or “anitary” apron  Menstrual aprons were worn under a dress or skirt as barrier protection.\n",
      "2309 A 1922 ad from the Venus Sanitary Service enthuses that barrier products are, \"Indispensable for Travel, Automobiling, Athletics, Emergency Uses.\"\n",
      "2310 The menstrual apron in Finley's collection is a reproduction, made by Ann Wass, who holds a PhD in costume and textile history and is the acting museum manager at the Riversdale House Museum in Riverdale Park, Md.\n",
      "2311 \"I think the reason they weren't marketed anymore is that they probably didn't work very well,\" Wass said in an email.\n",
      "2312 Kotex sanitary belt  If you're a woman younger than 40 or a man of any age, you will likely by mystified by the so-called \"sanitary belt.\"\n",
      "2313 Before self-adhesive menstrual pads of the 1970s, disposable pads had tabs at each end which were attached to a belt like this one.\n",
      "2314 Such words as \"sanitary,\" \"fresh\" and \"dainty\" frequently were used to describe products because, as Kissling explains in her book \"Capitalizing on the Curse: The Business of Menstruation,\" \"One must keep menstruation concealed, to present one's carefully constructed front of femininity from becoming damaged by the taint of menstrual pollution.\"\n",
      "2315 PMS Crunch  In 1995, Margie Ostrower, a former retail buyer from the Greater New York City area,created Time of the Month Inc., and began to market a novelty snack food, PMS Crunch.\n",
      "2316 There were two varieties available, basically chocolate mixed with nuts or other salty food.\n",
      "2317 Ostrower often felt uncomfortable about the name.\n",
      "2318 In an email, she told me, \"As you can imagine, if you met someone for the first time and told them that product name and Time of the Month Inc. was your company, it could come off a bit strange.\"\n",
      "2319 Sadly, PMS Crunch is no longer on the market, although Ostrower is considering a comeback.\n",
      "2320 “irst Moon”enstruation Kit  Products including \"First Moon\" encourage celebrating a girl's first period by throwing a party.\n",
      "2321 Bobel explained to me that such items are meant to offer a counter-narrative.\n",
      "2322 \"Menstruation is part of a complex, systemic cycle,\" she said.\n",
      "2323 \"It's a way to send a message to girls that it's not a hygienic crisis, but a transition from girlhood to womanhood, and really a cause for celebration.\"\n",
      "2324 This kit includes an instruction booklet, audio instruction tape, music cassette tape (it is, after all, from 1997), invitations, ribbon and ceremonial instruments, including speaking stone and candles.\n",
      "2325 Pad Pot and reusable belt and pad  Over the past few decades, the use of reusable supplies has been (at least for some) a form of \"menstrual activism.\"\n",
      "2326 \"It's been very much an intersection of different kinds of activists,\" Bobel said.\n",
      "2327 \"There are environmentalists who dislike putting so much into landfills; there are consumer-rights advocates who are concerned about the possible risks associated with conventional products; and there are feminist health activists who promote body literacy and challenge the notion that menstruation is necessarily a problem that should be hidden, but rather, simply a fact of life.\"\n",
      "2328 The pot doubles as a watering can; the spout aids with pouring the used soaking water over plants.\n",
      "2329 1928 Lysol ad  Lysol, that ubiquitous freshener of toddler cots, was once marketed as a douche.\n",
      "2330 \"Douches were presented for odor control, but they were also meant for contraception and could not be advertised that way,\" Elizabeth Kissling, a professor of women's and gender studies and communication studies at Eastern Washington University, told me in an email.\n",
      "2331 In fact, the federal ban on birth control for married couples was not lifted until 1965.\n",
      "2332 (The ban was lifted for single people in 1972.)\n",
      "2333 Douches flush sperm into the cervix, so they're not a good contraceptive, and ingredients in them can cause irritation and infection.\n",
      "2334 When used as a douche, Lysol contributed to poisoning, and, in some cases, death.\n",
      "2335 Ad for Pristeen  Oh, look!\n",
      "2336 A forlorn girl, sitting in a decimated patch of grass.\n",
      "2337 What ever could be the matter?\n",
      "2338 Pristeen knows: \"The trickiest deodorant problem a girl has isn't under her pretty little arms,\" the ad warns, capitalizing on the fear of \"feminine odor.\"\n",
      "2339 Despite the assurance that Pristeen works, \"calmly and quietly, all day long,\" the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends using no such sprays or deodorants, because they can irritate the skin, causing itching and burning,  “rowing Up and Liking It”ooklets (various years)  These educational booklets, given away to girls to promote brand loyalty between 1949 and 1972, were produced by the Personal Products Co., which was also the maker of Stayfree pads and OB tampons.\n",
      "2340 Along with information about the physiology of menstruation, the 1963 booklet explains, \"So much happens when a girl reaches her teens.\n",
      "2341 It's the time in your life when you first know the thrill of buying your own clothes.\n",
      "2342 When you wear make-up and nail polish for the first time.\"\n",
      "2343 The 1970 booklet informs the reader that \"Someday, when you fall in love and marry, you will want to have children.\"\n",
      "2344 By 1972, the format changed to three friends writing letters to one another about the challenges of growing up, including menstruation.\n",

      "2347 Let’ begin with the obvious: Every woman in the history of humanity has or had a period.\n",
      "2348 Each month, her uterus sheds its lining, sending blood flowing out through her vagina (unless she’ pregnant, in which case she gets a lengthy reprieve).\n",
      "2349 This process is as natural as eating, drinking and sleeping, and it’ beautiful too: There’ no human race without it.\n",
      "2350 Yet most of us loathe talking about it.\n",
      "2351 When girls first start their periods, they embark on a decades-long journey of silence and dread.\n",
      "2352 Periods hurt.\n",
      "2353 They cause backaches and cramps, not to mention a cloud of emotional ickiness—nd this goes on every month, for 30 to 40 years.\n",
      "2354 In public, people discuss periods as often as they discuss diarrhea.\n",
      "2355 Women shove pads or tampons up their sleeves on their way to the bathroom so no one knows it’ their “ime of the month.”hey get bloodstains on their clothes.\n",
      "2356 They stick wads of toilet paper in their underwear when they’e caught without supplies.\n",
      "2357 Meanwhile, ad campaigns sanitize this bloody mess with scenes of light blue liquids gently cascading onto fluffy white pads while women frolic in form-fitting white jeans.\n",
      "2358 In a 1978  satire  for Ms. magazine, feminist pioneer  Gloria Steinem  answered the question that so many women have asked: “hat would happen, for instance, if suddenly, magically, men could menstruate and women could not?\n",
      "2359 The answer is clear—enstruation would become an enviable, boast-worthy, masculine event: Men would brag about how long and how much,”he wrote.\n",
      "2360 Steinem envisioned a world where “en-struation”ustifies men’ place pretty much everywhere: in combat, political office, religious leadership positions and medical schools.\n",
      "2361 We’ have “aul Newman Tampons”nd “uhammad Ali’ Rope-a-Dope Pads”nd a new model for compliments:  “an, you lookin’ood!”  “eah, man, I’ on the rag!”  Nearly 40 years later, Steinem’ essay still stings because “enstrual equity”as gone almost nowhere.\n",
      "2362 Today, tampons and pads are taxed in most states while adult diapers, Viagra, Rogaine and potato chips are not.\n",
      "2363 Men can walk into any bathroom and access all of the supplies they need to care for themselves: toilet paper, soap, paper towels, even seat covers.\n",
      "2364 Women, however, cannot.\n",
      "2365 In most schools, girls have to trek to the nurse’ office to ask for a pad or tampon, as if menstruating is an illness rather than a natural function.\n",
      "2366 In most public and private places, women are lucky if there’ a cranky machine on the wall charging a few quarters for a pad that’ so uncomfortable you might prefer to use a wad of rough toilet paper instead.\n",
      "2367 No change?\n",
      "2368 You can pay for a parking spot with a credit card, but have you ever seen such technology on a tampon machine in a women’ bathroom?\n",
      "2369 The situation for prison inmates and homeless women is far direr.\n",
      "2370 Even if you do have access to tampons, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require companies to list the ingredients—et the average woman has a tampon inside her vagina for more than 100,000 hours over her lifetime.\n",
      "2371 Tampons may contain “esidue from chemical herbicides,”ays Sharra Vostral, a historian at Purdue University who wrote  Under Wraps: A History of Menstrual Hygiene Technology .\n",
      "2372 “e do not really understand the health consequences, because we are not testing for them in relation to tampons.”  If all this sounds unfair, try getting your period in the developing world.\n",
      "2373 Taboos, poverty, inadequate sanitary facilities, meager health education and an enduring culture of silence create an environment in which girls and women are denied what should be a basic right: clean, affordable menstrual materials and safe, private spaces to care for themselves.\n",
      "2374 At least 500 million girls and women globally lack adequate facilities for managing their periods, according to a  2015 report  from UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n",
      "2375 In rural India,  one in five  girls drops out of school after they start menstruating , according to research by Nielsen and Plan India, and of the 355 million menstruating girls and women in the country, just 12 percent use sanitary napkins.\n",
      "2376 “n today’ world, if there’ nobody dying it’ not on anyone’ agenda,”ays Venkatraman Chandra-Mouli, a WHO scientist who’ worked in adolescent health for the past 20 years.\n",
      "2377 “enstrual problems don’ kill anyone, but for me, they are still an extremely important issue because they affect how girls view themselves, and they affect confidence, and confidence is the key to everything.”  For something that has over  5,000 slang terms  (shark week, Bloody Mary, red wedding), the period is one of the most ignored human rights issues around the globe—ffecting everything from education and economics to the environment and public health—ut that’ finally starting to change.\n",
      "2378 In the past year, there have been so many pop culture moments around menstruation that  NPR  called 2015 “he year of the period,”nd  Cosmopolitan  said it was “he year the period went public.”e’l never have gender equality if we don’ talk about periods, but 2016 signaled the beginning of something better than talk: It’ becoming the year of menstrual change.\n",
      "2379 There’ a movement—ropelled by activists, inventors, politicians, startup founders and everyday people—o strip menstruation of its stigma and ensure that public policy keeps up.\n",
      "2380 For the first time, Americans are talking about gender equality, feminism and social change through women’ periods, which, as Steinem puts it, is “vidence of women taking their place as half the human race.”  #HappyToBleed  Menstruation wasn’ always so taboo.\n",
      "2381 In ancient and matrilineal cultures, it was a mark of honor and power, a sacred time for women to rest and revive their bodies.\n",
      "2382 Today, no one is going to the spa or taking a few days off of work to celebrate her period.\n",
      "2383 Menstruation has been cloaked in shame for centuries, but that silence was broken for a brief moment in 1970 when Dr. Edgar Berman, a member of the Democratic Party’ Committee on National Priorities, suggested that women could not hold office because of their “aging hormonal imbalances.”is comments were directed at U.S. Representative Patsy Mink of Hawaii, who had implored her party to focus on women’ issues.\n",
      "2384 Berman  asked  people to imagine a “enopausal woman president who had to make the decision of the Bay of Pigs,”r the president of a bank “aking a loan under these raging hormonal influences.”ink ridiculed his “isgusting performance,”orced his resignation—nd, for a very brief time, women’ periods had the floor.\n",
      "2385 Then 46 years went by without any change.\n",
      "2386 In January, President Barack Obama may have become the first president to  discuss  menstruation when 27-year-old YouTube sensation  Ingrid Nilsen  asked him why tampons and pads are taxed as luxury items in 40 states.\n",
      "2387 Obama was stunned.\n",
      "2388 “ have to tell you, I have no idea why states would tax these as luxury items,”e said.\n",
      "2389 “ suspect it’ because men were making the laws when those taxes were passed.”  Nilsen’ interview went viral, as has her frank approach to one of the most whispered-about issues in American culture and politics: menstruation .\n",
      "2390 “omething that affects people every single day the president didn’ know about!\n",
      "2391 And it’ because it’ one of those things that just gets buried,”he says.\n",
      "2392 “hat’ a reflection of how women’ bodies are viewed even today by our government and society.”  If pop culture is your barometer, periods broke into late-night TV in February when Samantha Bee went on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and  riffed  on all the ways a female comedian can refer to her “athing suit area,”s Colbert put it.\n",
      "2393 Bee was just days away from becoming the only woman in late night TV with her show, Full Frontal With Samantha Bee.\n",
      "2394 After reminding Colbert just how much he enjoys talking about the male anatomy (“aucus,”“uevos rancheros,”“enissippi”, she offered her own list of euphemisms for lady parts, including “epartment of the Interior,”“he place where I keep my keys”nd “he velour bouncy castle.”  Bee’ bit about “oo-hos”nd “a-has”idn’ come out of nowhere.\n",
      "2395 Over the last year, a steady stream of pop culture moments propelled menstrual equity—ka period feminism, bathroom equality or simply “ife,”s Steinem quips to Newsweek—nto the mainstream.\n",
      "2396 Musician Kiran Gandhi ran the 2015 London Marathon without a pad or tampon, crossing the finish line with a large red stain between her legs.\n",
      "2397 When artist Rupi Kaur posted a photo of herself on Instagram, fully-clothed and with a stain on her pants and sheets, the image was “ccidentally”aken down.\n",
      "2398 Twice.\n",
      "2399 Comedy Central pair Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele  schooled men  on periods: “hat if we told y’ll that once a month, half the human race is in pain?\n",
      "2400 And the other half don’ wanna hear shit about it?”onald Trump must have missed that skit, because he spawned the hashtag  #PeriodsAreNotAnInsult  when he complained about tough questions from GOP debate moderator Megyn Kelly, saying she had “lood coming out of her wherever.”rom awareness-raising hashtag campaigns ( #TheHomelessPeriod ,  #HappyToBleed ,  #FreeTheTampons ) to a Change.org) to a  petition  to lift the tampon tax to 20-year-old Arushi Dua asking Mark Zuckerberg to launch an “n my period”utton on Facebook to help fight menstrual stigmas in India, periods are having a moment.\n",
      "2401 This movement has been so widespread that Whoopi Goldberg is now launching a line of medical marijuana products to ease menstrual cramps.\n",
      "2402 Women are using their periods to protest Indiana Governor Mike Pence’ extreme anti-abortion legislation, calling, emailing and  tweeting  him with detailed updates on their daily flow.\n",
      "2403 Jennifer Lawrence answered the ubiquitous “ho are you wearing?”uestion with a story about menstruation, telling  Harper’ Bazaar  that she chose her red cutout Dior gown for the 2016 Golden Globes because the show coincided with her period and she wanted something that was “oose at the front… The other dress was really tight, and I’ not going to suck in my uterus.”  @GovPenceIN @periodsforpence  Started my cycle today.\n",

      "2405 —asha P (@Sasha827) April 6, 2016   It Absorbs the Worry…hen Kills You  U.S. consumers spent $3.1 billion on tampons, pads and sanitary panty liners last year, according to Euromonitor, and the global sanitary protection products market reached $30 billion.\n",
      "2406 Y et in the last century, there have only been three significant innovations in the field: disposable sanitary pads, first marketed in the late 19th century and updated with adhesive in 1969; commercial tampons in the 1930s; and menstrual cups, which became popular in the 1980s.\n",
      "2407 “f this isn’ a reflection of how women’ bodies are viewed, I don’ know what is!”ays Nilsen.\n",
      "2408 “ow could something this important not change over 40 to 50 years?”  Before pads and tampons, women folded soft gauze or flannels and pinned them to their undergarments when they had their periods (“n the rag”.\n",
      "2409 All that changed in the 1920s with Kotex sanitary pads, although they were only a cosmetic improvement.\n",

      "2414 (He also invented the diaphragm.)\n",
      "2415 As women pursued more physically demanding jobs during World War II, their need for comfortable, discreet, reliable products grew.\n",
      "2416 Between 1937 and 1943, tampons sales increased  five-fold , and 25 percent of women regularly used tampons in the early 1940s.\n",
      "2417 Mainstream American culture gradually embraced fem-care products.\n",
      "2418 Women started using tampons more than pads, and feminists heralded the tampon as a liberator.\n",
      "2419 “o one was thinking about safety hazards.\n",
      "2420 They were just grateful to have a product that plugs it up, literally,”ays Chris Bobel, president of the  Society for Menstrual Cycle Research  and an associate professor of women’ and gender studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston.\n",
      "2421 It was only in fringe, arty circles that people were pushing boundaries on tampon etiquette; feminist artist Judy Chicago’ 1971 “ed Flag”aptured a grainy, close-up shot of Chicago pulling a bloody tampon out of her vagina.\n",
      "2422 (Many assumed they were looking at a bloody penis, proving her point about period taboos.)\n",
      "2423 In 1975, Procter & Gamble began test-marketing a tea bag-shaped, super-absorbent tampon called Rely (tagline: “t even absorbs the worry”.\n",
      "2424 They were made of synthetic materials, and the key ingredient was carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), a compound that boosted absorption so much that the tampon could theoretically last for an entire period.\n",
      "2425 “’e talked to many people anecdotally who said, ‘ loved those tampons!’t was a fabulous new design,”ostral says.\n",
      "2426 But others found Rely tampons painful to remove: “hey absorbed so much fluid that they ripped the internal vaginal skin when you pulled them out.”nother problem: The teeth at the tip of the plastic applicator sometimes cut women.\n",
      "2427 They were also potentially lethal: CMC and polyester in tampons dried out women’ vaginas, creating the ideal breeding ground for the toxin-producing bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.\n",
      "2428 In 1980, 890 cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and  91 percent  of them were related to menstruation.\n",
      "2429 Thirty-eight women died.\n",
      "2430 At the time, around 70 percent of American women were using tampons, and while Rely had one-quarter of the market, it was responsible for 75 percent of TSS cases, prompting widespread panic.\n",
      "2431 Other super-absorbent tampon brands were implicated, including Playtex and Tampax, but Rely was the only one recalled in September 1980.\n",
      "2432 All tampon manufacturers faced lawsuits over TSS, but  over 1,100  were leveled against P&G.\n",
      "2433 In 1982, the FDA.\n",
      "2434 In 1982, the  required  tampon manufacturers to warn consumers about the link between tampon use and TSS.\n",
      "2435 By June 1983, the CDC had learned about  2,204  cases of TSS.\n",
      "2436 It wasn’ until 1989 that the FDA required manufacturers to standardize tampon absorbency levels and include warnings on tampon boxes.\n",
      "2437 In the 1980s and ’0s, the safety profile of tampons improved and the incidence of TSS plummeted, but there were still 636 cases of menstrual-related TSS between 1987 and 1996, according to the  CDC , 36 of them fatal.\n",
      "2438 While CMC was no longer used in tampons, an explosive 1995 Village Voice  article  revealed a new threat: Dioxin, a carcinogen that’ “oxic to the immune system”nd linked to birth defects, had been found in some commercial tampons.\n",
      "2439 The article slammed the FDA for sitting on memos revealing this link and for not testing tampons.\n",
      "2440 In a small victory for activists, the tampon industry reformed some bleaching practices to reduce the dioxin risk to trace levels, but problems remain.\n",
      "2441 The FDA does not require companies to disclose the ingredients in tampons and pads, which means we know more about where our clothes are made than we do about what women put inside their vaginas.\n",
      "2442 The average woman uses about 12,000 tampons in her lifetime, and that’ a conservative estimate, says Philip Tierno, a professor of microbiology at New York University School of Medicine who was among the first to link TSS with the synthetic materials in tampons.\n",
      "2443 “he FDA says dioxin is a trace, but it adds up when you’e talking about decades of use.”iscose rayon, which is made from sawdust, is still used in tampons.\n",
      "2444 As Tierno puts it, “t turns out to be one of the best of the bad ingredients.”  “e don’ have good, reliable data that tells us the things we’e putting inside our body, in the most absorbent part of our body, for days at a time, for 40 years, are safe or not,”ays Bobel.\n",
      "2445 “t’ symptomatic of the silence around menstruation.”  In 1997, U.S. Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York introduced the Tampon Safety and Research Act (now the  Robin Danielson Feminine Hygiene Product Safety Act , named for a woman who died of TSS in 1998) to require the National Institutes of Health to research the health risks associated with menstrual hygiene products, as well as urge the FDA to disclose the list of ingredients in tampons, pads and other period supplies.\n",
      "2446 Since then, she has reintroduced the bill eight times; it’ currently sitting with the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health.\n",
      "2447 “t is very difficult to get a bill passed, especially when it concerns women’ health.\n",
      "2448 The safety of tampons is not something that is on the minds of many members of Congress,”ays Maloney, speaking through a spokesperson.\n",
      "2449 “ believe one day we’l get this legislation passed.”  Until then, startups like  Lola  and  Conscious Period  offer women what Big Business doesn’: transparency.\n",
      "2450 Commercial tampons are made of some combination of cotton, rayon and synthetic fibers, but Lola tampons are made from 100 percent natural cotton.\n",

      "2571 She wanted to help them, but the women who used her machine complained that the foot pedal led to back pain.\n",
      "2572 So Bedekar tweaked the machine, simplifying the process, altering the design of the pads and adding wings for comfort.\n",

      "2637 ASHLEY CELIK: There was this one time when I was - it came out of nowhere.\n",
      "2638 And then I walked to the nurse's office, and there was a huge line.\n",
      "2639 MOGUL: And Ashley wasn't about to publicly announce what she needed.\n",

      "2652 Ferreras wants every single elementary, middle and high school in the city to have a free dispenser.\n",
      "2653 FERRERAS: In all my years as an elected official, I've never heard anyone concerned about the budget for toilet paper.\n",
      "2654 The reality is that is why we're legislating because this needs to be law, not just the budget item.\n",

      "2684 DELBENE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member McDermott, and members of the subcommittee.\n",
      "2685 I really appreciate the opportunity to testify today on my legislation to improve the small business health insurance tax credit.\n",
      "2686 As a former businesswoman and entrepreneur, I know firsthand that when small businesses and startups get the tools and the opportunities to succeed, America's economy is stronger.\n",
      "2687 And in my home state of Washington, there are over half a million small businesses.\n",
      "2688 They comprise 98 percent of all businesses and employ nearly 1.3 million workers, more than half of the state's private sector workforce.\n",
      "2689 Helping small businesses thrive is an important way to grow our economy across the country.\n",
      "2690 From the businesses that I've met with, I've heard repeatedly how important health coverage is to recruiting and retaining great employees, whether it's Bramble Berry in Bellingham or FROST donuts in Millcreek, they all want to provide quality coverage, but often find it too expensive, too complicated, or there are too few options that are available to them.\n",
      "2691 In fact, according to the small business majority, 70 percent of small business owners who don't offer health insurance to their workers say it's because they can't afford to do so.\n",
      "2692 These business owners just want a little bit of help.\n",
      "2693 And the Affordable Care Act took an important step in addressing this problem.\n",
      "2694 It created a tax credit to help small businesses afford the cost of health coverage for their workers and their families.\n",
      "2695 Unfortunately, the ACA Small Business Tax Credit isn't working as well as it was intended.\n",
      "2696 Too many businesses are either ineligible for the credit or discouraged by the complexity of its requirements.\n",
      "2697 In 2012, the Government Accountability Office found that only 170,000 small employers had claimed the credit, a fraction of the up to 4 million businesses that were estimated to be eligible by federal agencies and small business organizations.\n",
      "2698 To help small businesses compete and grow, Congress should make the tax credit more accessible to employers and available for a longer period of time.\n",
      "2699 That's precisely what my legislation would do.\n",
      "2700 Among other changes, the Small Business Tax Credit Accountability -- Accessibility Act would raise the maximum size of businesses that are eligible for the credit from 25 to 50 employees.\n",
      "2701 It would increase the number of years for which a small business can receive the credit, from two to three consecutive years, and eliminate eligibility requirements that are unnecessarily complex and discourage businesses from claiming the credit.\n",
      "2702 This proposal will go a long way towards ensuring that more small businesses can provide health coverage to their workers while continuing to compete and grow in a still fragile economy.\n",
      "2703 I'm grateful to have been able to partner with Congressman Kind on this effort along with Senators Coons and Merkley, who've introduced companion legislation in the Senate.\n",
      "2704 It enjoys broad support among industry, small businesses and health care organizations including the National Association of Health Underwriters, the National Grocers Association, the National Retail Federation, Third Way, and small business majority.\n",
      "2705 I urge members of this subcommittee to support it.\n",
      "2706 Members of Congress have a responsibility to be good stewards of public policy by keeping our laws updated and making adjustments when necessary to ensure that they work in the real world.\n",
      "2707 This is a common sense bill that will offer meaningful help to entrepreneurs and workers across the country, and I look forward to working with members of the committee from both sides of the aisle to move it forward.\n",
      "2708 Thank you so much for the time, and I yield back.\n",
      "2709 TIBERI: Thank you for joining us today.\n",
      "2710 We're now joined by the gentlelady representing the 6th District of New York.\n",
      "2711 Ms. Meng is now recognized for five minutes.\n",
      "2712 MENG: Thank you, Chairman Tiberi, Ranking Member McDermott, and our distinguished members of the subcommittee.\n",
      "2713 Thank you for the opportunity to share my proposals with you.\n",
      "2714 I'm here today to discuss H.R.\n",
      "2715 3117, the Fund Essential Menstruation Products or the FEM Products Act of 2015.\n",
      "2716 Before I get my legislation, I want to share just how important access to affordable feminine hygiene products is.\n",
      "2717 Access to these products is a serious and ongoing need for women and girls in the United States.\n",
      "2718 When women are able to purchase quality, safe and affordable feminine hygiene products, we are able to continue on with our daily lives, at work, at school and in our communities, with minimal interruption.\n",
      "2719 According to a Feeding America Survey from 2011, people across the country at all income levels listed these products as, quote, \"Items that cannot be foregone or easily substituted.\"\n",
      "2720 When women do not have access to sanitary feminine hygiene products, we are forced to substitute cheap materials and this can cause some serious health problems.\n",
      "2721 Unfortunately, this happens everyday in the United States.\n",
      "2722 This is a real issue in New York City, so much so that the YMCA of Greater New York began providing these products to young women and girls in order to make sure that these girls actually stayed in the programs and stayed in school.\n",
      "2723 The YMCA now provides these products as part of the first aid kits at many of their programs across our city.\n",
      "2724 Feminine hygiene products are also among the most requested items at food pantries and homeless shelters in New York City.\n",
      "2725 But this is not just an issue for low income or homeless women and girls.\n",
      "2726 Women make up 50.8 percent of the U.S. population.\n",
      "2727 And in an average lifetime, a woman will use about 10,000 tampons or pads, two of the most common types of products.\n",
      "2728 Purchasing these products is a continuous and costly expense for women that women must bear for much of our lives, from when menstruation begins at about age 12 to the time of menopause at approximately 54 years of age.\n",
      "2729 Many women will spend at least $7,000 over the course of our lives.\n",
      "2730 Now, different populations of women and girls face different barriers in terms of access to affordable feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "2731 I introduced H.R.3117 to help women and their families to mitigate the costs of purchasing these products.\n",
      "2732 This bill will also add feminine hygiene products to the list of items that can be purchased with funds in an FSA, flexible spending account.\n",
      "2733 An FSA allows for individuals to place up to $2,550 of their income in an untaxed account where the money currently can be used for certain medical expenses, like bandages, crutches and prescription medications.\n",
      "2734 It only makes sense to include tampons, pads, and other feminine hygiene products as well.\n",
      "2735 I also plan to introduce legislation that would create a refundable tax credit for feminine hygiene products for individuals who regularly use them.\n",
      "2736 I'm currently in discussion with advocates and industry experts to best determine yearly expenses.\n",
      "2737 And I will scale the tax credit accordingly.\n",
      "2738 It would cover low and middle- income individuals and families, and there would be no limit to the number of dependents who can claim this credit.\n",
      "2739 A family with three teenage daughters or a same-sex female couples should receive a credit in accordance with their real costs.\n",
      "2740 I've already spoken at length about the great need for assistance in this area.\n",
      "2741 A tax credit would help families afford these costly items and ensure that women and girls can continue to lead their lives without worrying about this basic health care need.\n",
      "2742 My efforts are part of an international movement to make these products more affordable through common sense tax policy.\n",
      "2743 Currently, 40 of -- out of the 45 states that have a sales tax charge these products as luxury items.\n",
      "2744 The sales tax is affectionately known as the Tampon Tax.\n",
      "2745 In the past year, legislation to remove the tax has been introduced in seven states, including my home state of New York, where it has already passed both houses of the state legislature and is awaiting the governor's signature.\n",
      "2746 On the international stage, Canada got rid of this tax last year and the United Kingdom has engaged in a heated debate over the issue for the past year as well.\n",
      "2747 This is a complicated issue, because different populations of women and girls face different barriers in terms of accessibility and affordability.\n",
      "2748 As members of Congress, we should ensure that women and girls have access to safe, quality and affordable feminine hygiene products however we can.\n",
      "2749 Thank you.\n",
      "2750 TIBERI: Thanks for your testimony.\n",
      "2751 We are now joined by the gentlelady from the 2nd District of Arizona.\n",
      "2752 Ms. McSally, you're recognized for five minutes.\n",
      "2753 MCSALLY: Thank you, Chairman Tiberi and Ranking Member McDermott, for hosting this important hearing to discuss tax-related proposals to improve health care, and for the opportunity to discuss legislation I introduced earlier this Congress.\n",
      "2754 Much attention has been given to taxes that pay for the Affordable Care Act, such as the Medical Device Tax or the Cadillac Tax, but buried in the Affordable Care Act is a lesser-known tax increase that is already hurting middle-class families and is about to hit seniors.\n",
      "2755 My bill, H.R.3590, the Halt Tax Increases on the Middle Class and Seniors Act, protects seniors from this tax hike, and rolls it back for middle-class families.\n",
      "2756 Health care costs are already high.\n",
      "2757 Since 2005, have risen faster than inflation every year except 2008.\n",
      "2758 Additionally, the trend towards rising health insurance deductibles is leaving people exposed to increasing out-of-pocket expenses.\n",
      "2759 We should be working to reduce this burden, not making it worse.\n",
      "2760 But that's not what this hidden tax hike in the Affordable Care Act would do.\n",
      "2761 Currently, the IRS allows Americans with high health care costs to deduct certain out-of-pocket expenses from their taxes.\n",
      "2762 Before 2013, individuals could deduct out-of-pocket medical costs that exceeded 7.5 percent of one's Adjusted Gross Income, or AGI.\n",
      "2763 The Affordable Care Act changed that for Americans under the age of 65 by increasing the threshold to 10 percent of an individual's AGI, effectively raising taxes on middle class Americans.\n",
      "2764 To make matters worse, the same tax is scheduled to hit Americans 65 and older starting on January 1, 2017.\n",
      "2765 Though it has not received much attention, the medical expense deduction means a great deal to some of the most vulnerable Americans.\n",
      "2766 According to the IRS, more than 10 million people use this deduction, 87 percent of them earn less than $100,000 a year.\n",
      "2767 The average family taking advantage of this deduction makes just over $58,000, a year and has seen an income tax increase of several hundred dollars per year since the threshold was raised for those under 65 in 2013.\n",
      "2768 This deduction is extremely important for low and middle income Americans, who have already spent thousand in out-of-pocket medical costs and they can't afford another shock to their wallets.\n",
      "2769 The same goes for seniors, many of whom already live on fixed incomes and struggle to make ends meet.\n",
      "2770 Currently, seniors make up 56 percent of all claimants of the medical expense deduction.\n",
      "2771 If the threshold is raised in January 2017, many seniors who have saved for their entire lives and have carefully planned for retirement will suddenly be faced with hundreds of dollars in extra taxes on top of the out-of-pocket medical costs they already pay.\n",
      "2772 That's why I introduced H.R.3590, a bipartisan bill to stop this tax increase for seniors and roll it back for those under 65.\n",
      "2773 The impetus for this legislation came to me from one of my constituents from Green Valley, Arizona.\n",
      "2774 His name is Loren Thorson (ph).\n",
      "2775 Tragically, Loren (ph) passed away earlier this year, but he knew the importance of raising awareness of this tax hike and was committed to doing what he could to stop it.\n",
      "2776 In closing, I want to thank the 14 co-sponsors including Congressman Lynn Jenkins, a member of this subcommittee, as well as and Congressman Bob Dold and Jason Smith, members of the Full Committee, and the various groups that are supporting the legislation to include the AARP, Americans for Prosperity, 60 Plus, Americans for Tax Reform, the Association of Mature American Citizens, and the National Taxpayer Union.\n",
      "2777 I encourage the committee to consider my bill, and I look forward to working with you to protect seniors and the middle-class Americans from the tax hike that they just cannot afford.\n",
      "2778 Thank you.\n",
      "2779 TIBERI: Thank you, Ms. McSally.\n",
      "2780 You are last but not the least, very good.\n",
      "2781 I appreciate that.\n",
      "2782 I'd like to thank all of our colleagues for appearing before us today, and appreciate all the time and work you and your staff have done to put time into these bills.\n",
      "2783 Last month, our committee started robust conversation about how we can modernize the tax code to deliver the high-quality, affordable, portable health care options Americans deserve and expect.\n",
      "2784 And I'm happy we had the time to pursue regular order today, and make a public record of efforts that can help us achieve that stated goal.\n",
      "2785 Please be advised that members will have two weeks to submit written questions to be answered later in writing.\n",
      "2786 Those questions and your answers will be made part of the formal hearing record.\n",
      "2787 Without -- the subcommittee stands adjourned.\n",

      "3204 The gender pay gap often takes the spotlight when it comes to women's financial issues.\n",
      "3205 But on the spending side of the equation is an equally worrisome problem: Women must pay more for many things, including some big-budget items, throughout their lives.\n",
      "3206 In fact, a recent study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs compared the city's local prices on nearly 800 products from toys and children's clothing to personal care products and senior health care products.\n",
      "3207 It found that women's products, on average, cost 7% more than similar products for men.\n",
      "3208 The higher costs are not necessarily due to discriminatory practices.\n",
      "3209 (And the difference in price doesn't always favor men.\n",
      "3210 For example, a Y chromosome typically bumps up prices for life and car insurance.)\n",
      "3211 Still, that doesn't make bigger bills for women any easier to manage.\n",
      "3212 What will help is knowing to expect them.\n",
      "3213 When establishing short-term budgets and long-term financial plans, recognize that gender is a factor, and plan accordingly.\n",
      "3214 You need to be prepared to pay more for the following six items if you've got double Xs.\n",
      "3215 Retirement  Good news: Women are expected to live longer than ever before.\n",
      "3216 Bad news: A longer life requires a bigger nest egg.\n",
      "3217 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, for babies born in 2014, females will outlive males by nearly five years--a life expectancy of 81.1 years for women and 76.5 years for men.\n",
      "3218 Those extra years at the end of life can be particularly costly and will greatly affect retirement savings plans.\n",
      "3219 \"When you live longer, you'll likely run into medical issues that need to be taken into account as part of your living expenses,\" says Nicole Mayer, financial adviser with RPG Life Transition Specialists, in Riverwoods, Ill. \"So certainly saving more for retirement for a female is important.\"\n",
      "3220 How to spend less  There's no getting around the need for a bigger nest egg to cover your longer life span, but you can take steps to avoid shortchanging yourself in retirement.\n",
      "3221 If you're married, boost your survivor payouts from your spouse's pension and Social Security benefits.\n",
      "3222 And married or not, maximize your own retirement savings throughout your career--by putting extra emphasis on retirement benefits when evaluating new jobs, making catch-up contributions once you turn 50, and more.\n",
      "3223 SEE ALSO: 9 Smart Retirement Strategies for Women  Cars  More good news: Ladies are closing the car-cost gap, at least on the younger end of the age spectrum.\n",
      "3224 But women over age 65 continue to pay significantly more for cars than buyers of any other demographic.\n",
      "3225 In a 1995 study in which actors negotiated new-car purchases with unwitting dealers, economists Ian Ayres and Peter Siegelman showed that white males were routinely quoted lower prices than black or female test buyers.\n",
      "3226 Nearly two decades later, a new study analyzing more than 10 million new-car sales in the U.S. and Canada between 2002 and 2009 indicates that men and women between the ages of 25 and 30 pay nearly equal prices for the same car type.\n",
      "3227 Unfortunately, after age 30, a gap develops between genders, with women paying increasingly more than men for cars.\n",
      "3228 Women age 70 and older tend to pay the highest prices, $236 more on average than men between age 30 and 35, who pay the lowest prices.\n",
      "3229 What causes this price drift with age?\n",
      "3230 \"One popular theory is that older people don't research as much,\" says economist Ambarish Chandra, co-author of this study along with Sumeet Gulati and James Sallee.\n",
      "3231 How to spend less  Before you visit the dealership, use sites such as Edmunds.com, KBB.com or Truecar.com to compare actual prices paid by other buyers so you can negotiate for the best new-car deal.\n",
      "3232 Or consider a car-buying service, which is ideal for people who simply hate to haggle.\n",
      "3233 You can also buy a used car online to skip the negotiating process.\n",
      "3234 Health Care  Women spend, on average, $1,136 out of pocket on health care per year, or 35.5% more than men ($838 per person), according to 2010 data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n",
      "3235 Younger women tend to face the biggest bills.\n",
      "3236 Women between ages 19 and 44 spend 54.2% more out of pocket on health care than men of the same age, mainly due to the high cost of bearing kids.\n",
      "3237 But even child-free women are typically burdened with greater health care demands and costs--for example, for annual gynecological exams, birth control and over-the-counter products such as tampons (plus the tampon tax).\n",
      "3238 Longer lifespans for women will mean more years paying more for health care.\n",
      "3239 How to spend less  You can move to a slowly growing list of places that does not tax tampons as a \"luxury good\" (which includes Minnesota, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland).\n",
      "3240 Otherwise, take advantage of flexible spending accounts and health savings accounts when possible, to save on taxes.\n",
      "3241 You can also trim spending with strategies as simple as staying in your insurer's network or switching to generic drugs.\n",
      "3242 SEE ALSO: 50 Ways to Cut Your Health Care Costs  Personal Care  The costs of daily care add up--and more so for women.\n",
      "3243 For example, a 2011 study, \"The Cost of Doing Femininity,\" found that men's deodorant costs just $1.15 per ounce while women's deodorant costs $1.44 per ounce.\n",
      "3244 Razors for men are $2.67 each; for women, $3.00 each.\n",
      "3245 Even President Obama has publicly lamented the inequity of dry cleaning: It costs an average $2.06 to clean a man's shirt and $3.95 for a woman's shirt.\n",
      "3246 Such price differences are not always due to discrimination.\n",
      "3247 Products for men and women are produced and marketed differently.\n",
      "3248 But those differences point to a bigger issue.\n",
      "3249 \"It simply costs women more to perform the culturally expected functions of femininity than for men to match up with cultural expectations of masculinity,\" says sociologist Nicholas Guittar, co-author of the study.\n",
      "3250 How to spend less  To affect the bigger picture, talk to your dry cleaner or other service provider who practices gendered pricing.\n",
      "3251 \"It may not impact that one interaction, but an increased cultural dialogue holds a lot of value,\" says Guittar.\n",
      "3252 In the meantime, stock up for less at drugstores and mass retailers such as Target and Walmart.\n",
      "3253 Keep in mind that store brand items can be much cheaper while offering similar quality.\n",
      "3254 Also, you may be able to find better deals on a retailer's site than in its stores, so be sure to check online, too.\n",
      "3255 Or simply buy gender-neutral products or the cheaper men's products.\n",
      "3256 But before you opt to skimp too much on personal care, remember that it is an investment of sorts--especially for women.\n",
      "3257 A recent study by sociologist Jaclyn Wong and Andrew Penner showed that good grooming (as well as attractiveness) is correlated to higher incomes.\n",
      "3258 In other words, paying attention to your clothing, hair and makeup can actually pay off.\n",
      "3259 For example, the study showed that a well-groomed woman would earn about $6,000 more annually than an averagely groomed woman (of equal attractiveness).\n",
      "3260 Annuities  Women's longevity, once again, wears down their wallets when it comes to certain types of annuities.\n",
      "3261 Monthly payouts for immediate single-life annuities are based in part on life expectancy.\n",
      "3262 Because women tend to live longer, they must invest much more to get the same monthly annuity payout that a man would.\n",
      "3263 For example, according to estimates from immediateannuities.com, a 65-year-old man from Virginia can purchase an annuity that will pay him $2,000 a month for the rest of his life for about $360,000.\n",
      "3264 A Virginia woman of the same age would need to pay more than $400,000 for the same annuity.\n",
      "3265 How to spend less  For equal payouts, you can opt to set a defined schedule.\n",
      "3266 For example, a 65-year-old Virginia resident can buy an annuity that will pay $2,000 a month for ten years for about $222,000, regardless of gender.\n",
      "3267 If you outlive those payments, you can purchase another annuity later.\n",
      "3268 (If you don't, the money goes to a beneficiary as scheduled.)\n",
      "3269 Unfortunately, in the long run (should you be so lucky), this strategy of building an annuity ladder may wind up costing you more.\n",
      "3270 But an upside to laddering: annuities purchased later may come with bigger payouts if interest rates rise.\n",
      "3271 SEE ALSO: Add an Annuity to Your Retirement-Income Mix  Long-Term-Care Insurance  Most long-term-care insurers charge single women about 40% to 60% more than single men for new policies, according to the American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance.\n",
      "3272 The reason for such a drastic price disparity is that women tend to live longer and make more claims than men.\n",
      "3273 For example, Genworth--the first big insurer to introduce gendered pricing for long-term-care insurance--estimates that a 55-year-old single man from Colorado would pay an annual premium of about $1,725 for a policy with a $150 daily benefit for three years.\n",
      "3274 A single woman of the same age would face an annual premium of nearly $2,113 for the same policy in Colorado.\n",
      "3275 How to spend less  You can generally avoid the extra charge if you buy a policy as a couple.\n",
      "3276 If the Colorado man and woman cited above bought the same plan together, they'd each pay about $1,300 a year.\n",
      "3277 Married or single, you should check whether your employer offers long-term-care coverage; insurers still charge men and women the same amount for plans purchased through an employer.\n",

      "3285 It takes effect Jan. 1.\n",
      "3286 Illinois became the third state —ith New York and Connecticut —o abolish the tax just this year, among 15 states where legislation was introduced, said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf of the Brennan Center for Justice.\n",

      "3290 The Illinois Senate sponsor, Democrat Melina Bush of Grayslake, said she wants to expand the ban for other products.\n",
      "3291 The original bill also exempted additional feminine hygiene items along with incontinence products.\n",
      "3292 \"This is just the start of a conversation about the unfair 'pink taxes' women face as they buy products priced higher than similar ones marketed to men or, in this case, as they have to spend on products that men don't,\" Bush said in a prepared statement.\n",
      "3293 Both houses of the General Assembly adopted the legislation last spring without opposition.\n",
      "3294 \"Compared to other political issues, this has more broad appeal and bipartisan consensus than anything, which is remarkable because it was so off-limits and so taboo for most of our lives,\" Weiss-Wolf said.\n",
      "3295 The average statewide sales tax is 6.25 percent.\n",
      "3296 But those taxes can run as high as 10.25 percent in Chicago because of city and county surcharges.\n",
      "3297 Terry Horstman, spokesman for the Illinois Department of Revenue, said Friday the law will cost the state $10 million to $15 million annually at the state rate.\n",
      "3298 Illinois has a multibillion-dollar deficit, but overall sales tax revenues will hit nearly $1 billion this year.\n",
      "3299 Weiss-Wolf suggested there are ways to make up the difference.\n",

      "3301 In Kentucky, barbecued sunflower seeds are off-limits to the tax man.\n",

      "3606 At midnight the day before fall classes began at Brown University, Viet Nguyen and six other student government representatives crept through campus, looking for bathrooms.\n",
      "3607 In their hands they held small baskets of feminine hygiene products to stash nside, name-brand tampons and sanitary pads that the next day students would be encouraged to take and use, all free.\n",
      "3608 They hit 30 buildings and an estimated 70 bathrooms — en's, women's and gender-neutral — n two hours.\n",
      "3609 \"We were really efficient,\" Nguyen told The Washington Post early Friday.\n",
      "3610 \"It was kind of fun.\"\n",
      "3611 Their late-night deliveries marked the launch of a campuswide initiative to promote ampons and pads as not a luxury item, but as much of a bathroom necessity as toilet paper or hand soap —he latest iteration of a national movement sparked earlier this year when debate over the \"tampon tax\" emerged.\n",
      "3612 Some states, including Rhode Island, home to Brown, introduced bills to repeal he tampon tax, which labeled feminine hygiene products as luxury goods or nonnecessities, and this summer, New York City officials announced plans to distribute tampons and pads free throughout public schools, homeless shelters and jails.\n",
      "3613 These efforts motivated Nguyen, student government president, and his executive board to make Brown one of the first — f not the first — igher education institution to follow suit.\n",
      "3614 \"We thought we could be the tipping point,\" Nguyen said, \"pushing conversation to action.\"\n",
      "3615 Beginning this week, the Undergraduate Council of Students at Brown will take responsibility for stocking all bathrooms in academic buildings across campus with the products.\n",
      "3616 Once a week, student government representatives will return to replenish supplies.\n",
      "3617 They hope, eventually, the university will take on that responsibility.\n",
      "3618 The launch comes on the heels of a months-long effort, organized mostly online between UCS executive board members scattered across the country for the summer.\n",
      "3619 They allocated funds in their budget, provided by the Undergraduate Finance Board, and talked logistics ith university officials.\n",
      "3620 Tuesday, the day before classes resumed, Nguyen, a senior studying education policy, sent a letter to the student body, notifying them of the new program.\n",
      "3621 \"We hope that this step, making Brown one of the first institutions in higher education to implement such a program at this scale, will motivate other universities and student governments to take similar actions to address this issue of equity,\" the letter read.\n",
      "3622 And fter just two days, Nguyen said they have received a dozen nthusiastic calls and emails from other universities, coast to coast, seeking guidance on how to kick-start their own programs.\n",
      "3623 But along with the positive feedback, Nguyen said, there has been plenty of opposition.\n",
      "3624 Almost all of it has centered on one element of the program — he decision to stock the men's room, too.\n",
      "3625 \"We anticipated it,\" Nguyen said of the backlash, \"but it's a different thing to anticipate it and then get the hate mail coming in.\"\n",
      "3626 Several conservative news outlets led with that information, prompting reactions like this on social media:  \"Only at a liberal cult university, would you find tampon dispensers in the men's room.\"\n",
      "3627 \"Ivy crazy.\"\n",
      "3628 \"INSANITY.\"\n",
      "3629 \"STOP THE MADNESS!\"\n",
      "3630 In its headline, Breitbart wrote \"Brown University Providing Tampons in men's bathrooms because 'both sexes menstruate,' \" though the quote was unattributed and did not appear in the text of the story.\n",
      "3631 Mediaite, in a similar headline, wrote \"Brown Univ.\n",
      "3632 to Put Tampons in ALL Bathrooms: 'Not All People Who Menstruate Are Women,' \" though, that quote was unattributed as well.\n",
      "3633 Nguyen, for his part, said the decision was not about redefining who does and doesn't biologically menstruate.\n",
      "3634 The UCS simply wanted to promote an environment of transgender-inclusivity.\n",
      "3635 In the letter to the student body, Nguyen wrote that the executive board hopes \"to set a more inclusive standard for this issue moving forward, both in terms of the language used and how future initiatives will be implemented, keeping in mind that menstruation is experienced by more than just those who identify as women and that not all people who identify as women menstruate.\"\n",
      "3636 Someone can identify as a transgender man and still biologically resemble a woman, so just providing tampons to those who use the women's restroom would not serve all students who require the products, Nguyen said.\n",
      "3637 It's unclear how much the new initiative will cost UCS, Nguyen said, and he declined to provide estimates.\n",
      "3638 He did, however, say that the products were not generic, but name brand — nd that they chose tampons with sleek plastic applicators.\n",
      "3639 The debate over the \"tampon tax,\" and whether women should be penalized for products they cannot biologically help but need, has been raging for nearly  year.\n",
      "3640 California was one of the first states where a bill was introduced to lash taxes from menstrual products, with State Assembly Member Cristina Garcia (D) leading the fight.\n",
      "3641 In a news elease from January, Garcia wrote that women in California pay over $20 million annually in taxes on tampons and pads —n additional, unnecessary price on products that are already expensive, especially for poor women.\n",
      "3642 After the bill was introduced in California, similar bills in other states followed.\n",
      "3643 Lawmakers passed them in Illinois, New York and Connecticut.\n",
      "3644 In Rhode Island, where Brown University is located, state legislators introduced a bill but it stalled n committee, reported the Associated Press.\n",
      "3645 State lawmakers vowed to revisit the issue in the upcoming legislative session.\n",
      "3646 In a statement to the AP bout the Brown University initiative, National Organization for Women President Terry O'Neill praised the effort, echoing that tampons are as necessary as toilet paper.\n",
      "3647 \"Students' participation in school should not be hindered by insufficient access to this basic necessity,\" O'Neill told the AP.\n",
      "3648 \"Universities around the country should follow suit.\"\n",
      "3649 Nguyen hopes that one day, the program will become \"an institutional part of Brown.\"\n",

      "3656 In all, the seven tax breaks the Democratic governor announced Tuesday that he had vetoed would have added up to $300 million a year, he said.\n",
      "3657 \"As I said last year, tax breaks are the same as new spending —hey both cost the General Fund money.\n",
      "3658 As such, they must be considered during budget deliberations so that all spending proposals are weighed against each other at the same time,\" Brown said in a news release accompanying his announcement.\n",

      "3660 Women lawmakers had hoped to make California the latest state to scrap the so-called \"tampon tax,\" which they argue is an unfair burden on a necessary hygiene product that is not a luxury.\n",
      "3661 At least five other states and some countries have already enacted laws ending such taxes as part of an international movement to depict them as discriminatory.\n",

      "3674 Brown, a Democrat, cited imperatives of fiscal restraint and viable revenue streams in blocking the bipartisan bill, which would have added tampons, sanitary napkins and other menstrual products to a list of necessities such as food and prescription medicines that are exempt from sales tax.\n",
      "3675 Brown also vetoed several similar bills that would have ended certain state taxes for diapers and other items.\n",

      "3724 Democrats and Republicans worried about how the bill defined the words \"substantially similar\" as they applied to products, and sought changes to eliminate strong financial penalties for violations, according to the Consumer Federation of California, which sponsored the bill.\n",

      "4317 The Bismarck Tribune, Bismarck, Feb.1  Gun measure not the answer for schools  Everyone wants their children to be in a safe environment when they go to school.\n",
      "4318 The goal of House Bill 1310 is to ensure that students have an added layer of protection while in school.\n",
      "4319 The bill would allow a member of a school's staff with a Class 1 concealed carry firearms license to carry a weapon on school grounds with the permission of the school's board.\n",
      "4320 The staffer would be required to take a 40-hour law enforcement training course to learn basic tactics and topics, such as firearms proficiency and how to respond to an event.\n",
      "4321 Those approved to carry a weapon also would have to agree to coordinate with law enforcement if an incident occurs.\n",
      "4322 A 10-hour annual refresher course also would be required.\n",
      "4323 The bill is intended to fill a gap for schools that can't afford a school resource officer, mostly smaller or rural schools.\n",
      "4324 Good intentions, however, don't always result in good legislation.\n",
      "4325 The Tribune doesn't believe that HB1310 provides a safe alternative for schools.\n",
      "4326 The flaws in the bill were pointed out during committee hearing testimony.\n",
      "4327 Questions were raised over whether a 40-hour training course was enough to prepare a school staffer to respond to someone with a gun.\n",
      "4328 Law enforcement is concerned about the liability involved with providing training.\n",
      "4329 There's also no way to know, argue the bill's opponents, how a school staffer will respond when confronted by a potential gunman.\n",
      "4330 Will the staffer act in the right way or will he or she freeze?\n",
      "4331 \"What happens if some of the good guys get shot?\"\n",
      "4332 asked Jon Martinson, executive director of the North Dakota School Boards Association, before the committee hearing.\n",
      "4333 While money is tight this legislative session, it would make more sense to find a way to provide funds to schools that want to hire a school resource officer.\n",
      "4334 It would be more of a deterrent to have a trained officer on duty than to rely on a teacher or administrator.\n",
      "4335 It's commendable they are willing to put themselves at risk to protect their students, but it's not the safest answer to the problem.\n",
      "4336 It's fortunate that North Dakota hasn't had a major shooting incident at a school.\n",
      "4337 Sadly, it's also true that it can happen anywhere.\n",
      "4338 Again, the best solution is a trained officer.\n",
      "4339 There are other gun-related bills before the Legislature.\n",
      "4340 House Bill 1169 would make it legal for people who are 21 years old or older to carry a concealed firearm without a permit in the state.\n",
      "4341 House Bill 1273 would change laws surrounding guns in churches.\n",
      "4342 In both cases the sponsors have good intentions.\n",
      "4343 Any bills dealing with firearms in society need a close look.\n",
      "4344 Overall, North Dakotans are very responsible when handling guns.\n",
      "4345 Accidents can and do occur and when dealing with firearm legislation safety should be our primary concern.\n",
      "4346 ___  Minot Daily News, Minot, Feb. 1  Legislature has eye on the ball.\n",
      "4347 the oddball  Some have openly posited that perhaps things should change and the North Dakota Legislature should be scheduled to meet annually as opposed to bi-annually.\n",
      "4348 Judging from the session so far, perhaps the opposite approach should be considered.\n",
      "4349 Maybe once every four or five years is plenty.\n",
      "4350 At issue isn't the necessary functions of government, which presumably legislators will get around to at some point.\n",
      "4351 Instead, the issue is the number of absurd, blatantly political or poorly thought-out legislation representatives bring to Bismarck and want to debate as if serious.\n",
      "4352 This is a waste of time and money and an embarrassment to North Dakota voters.\n",
      "4353 So far in this session, we have seen a proposal to loosen restrictions on use of guns to protect oneself and one's property against criminals.\n",
      "4354 Or potential criminals.\n",
      "4355 Or fleeing potential criminals.\n",
      "4356 Dodge City may have had more restrictions in the 19th century than North Dakota would have should this legislation pass.\n",

      "4358 Because apparently, stopping to shoot them would take too much time.\n",
      "4359 Legislators also heard from the anti \"tampon tax\" lobby, dutifully working on the global cause of trying to have female hygiene products exempted from sales tax.\n",
      "4360 This is our Legislature at work.\n",
      "4361 Sure, there are probably some important items that will come along.\n",

      "4601 -- The CBO analysis also found that the plan to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding would leave many women without services to help them prevent pregnancy, resulting in \"thousands\" of additional births, which would in turn jack up Medicaid costs.Sandhya Somashekhar reports: \"The analysts estimated that excluding the women's health organization from the Medicaid program for one year, as congressional Republicans have proposed, would particularly affect low-income areas and communities without many health care options, leaving 15 percent of those people 'without services that help women avert pregnancy.'\n",
      "4602 The reduction in services would reduce federal spending on Medicaid, the state-federal program for the poor, by $178 million during 2017, the analysts estimate.\n",
      "4603 But they believe the savings would be partially offset by the fact that there would be 'several thousand' more births paid for under Medicaid, which already picks up the costs of about 45 percent of all U.S. births; many of those new babies likely would qualify for the Medicaid program.\"\n",
      "4604 -- Another indictment from the CBO: The House Republicans' mechanism for persuading healthy Americans to stay insured would be largely ineffective, and it would ultimately lead to about 2 million fewer Americans buying insurance each year.Juliet Eilperin explains: \"GOP lawmakers are determined to repeal the individual mandate.…ut by jettisoning what has grown over time to a hefty penalty, several experts said, lawmakers have crafted a financial incentive that many consumers are unlikely to find compelling.\n",
      "4605 Under the House GOP proposal, any consumer who opts out of getting insurance would have to pay a 30 percent surcharge on one year's premium upon re-enrolling.\n",
      "4606 That compares with the current tax penalty under the 2010 law, which is calculated as the higher of either 2.5 percent of household income or a flat-dollar amount per adult and child in a family, for a total that cannot exceed $2,085.\n",
      "4607 …nitially under the Republican approach, the CBO projects, 'roughly 1 million people would be induced to purchase insurance in 2018 to avoid possibly having to pay the surcharge in the future.'\n",

      "4985 The average woman has an estimated 500 menstrual cycles in her lifetime, so feminine hygiene product makers have an ever-replenishing customer base.\n",
      "4986 Demands for these products are changing, as women seek not only more environmentally friendly options, but also ones that can accommodate an active lifestyle.\n",
      "4987 Also encouraging the trend: The earlier onset of puberty, technology and fabric advancements and more advertising targeting teenagers and younger women as older brand-loyal women enter menopause.\n",
      "4988 \"It's been many years of consistently agitating women, attending conferences, advertising, and I definitely think the concept has caught on and a lot of women now know about it,\" said Carinne Chambers, vice president and co-founder of DivaCup, who began developing menstrual products with her mother, Francine, over a decade ago.\n",
      "4989 \"But we've barely scratched the surface, and we're working hard to try and get women to know that this concept exists, and get over the initial hesitation of trying it. \"\n",
      "4990 Similarly, Thinx founder and \"she-EO\" Miki Agrawal didn't think sanitary cups were a modern-enough option for busy women like her: \"There's only been three major innovations in the entire 20th century: tampons, pads and menstrual cups.\n",
      "4991 So there was this huge opportunity to disrupt the category that totally needed disrupting. \"\n",
      "4992 While Thinx has attracted female customers with its eye-catching marketing campaigns and aggressively feminist messaging, Agrawal recently stepped down from her role as Thinx's CEO amid news reports about her poor leadership style and the company's volatile work environment.\n",
      "4993 Both Chambers and Agrawal credited social media for creating a more fertile space for women to discuss their menstrual health.\n",
      "4994 To reach potential consumers, they identified the importance of strong, positive messaging in their respective ads.\n",
      "4995 \"The average woman spends $150-$300 a year on feminine hygiene disposables, and one DivaCup retails for around $40, and women only need to replace that annually, so you do the math,\" Chambers said.\n",
      "4996 \"It's definitely cost-saving compared to the disposable products.\n",
      "4997 The average woman menstruates for over 30 years of her life, so when you add that up, that's a lot of cost savings, not to mention the amount of waste in landfills. \"\n",
      "4998 The arithmetic is the same for Thinx, which costs $30 a pair on average and reduces worries about dry-cleaning costs and ruined sheets.\n",
      "4999 For Varnam, embracing the products she uses is all about giving women choices.\n",
      "5000 Next up, she plans to try sea sponge tampons.\n",
      "5001 She estimated she spent $50 to get started with the products she can reuse over and over versus $10 for a box of tampons every month and foresees a day when she makes her own homemade menstrual pads and hosts workshops to teach other women how to, too.\n",
      "5002 \"I can't imagine using tampons or something disposable now, because it's so expensive and so bad for the earth,\" Varnum explained, adding that she dilutes the menstrual blood she collects with water and uses it to water her plants, which she says helps them thrive and makes her feel more aligned with the earth.\n",
      "5003 \"Once I had this relationship with my blood where this isn't gross, it makes me feel better and I'm allowed to be a woman. \"\n",
      "5004 One reason the feminine hygiene segment was ripe for innovation is the taboo nature of menstruation.\n",
      "5005 But in recent years, marketers have successfully taken aim at other below-the-belt topics-- like incontinence with the Depends ad starring \"Days of Our Lives\" actress Lisa Rinna and erectile dysfunction with numerous drug companies' print and broadcast campaigns.\n",
      "5006 Recently, talk of menstruation has extended to the halls of state governments, as advocates have fought to end the so-called tampon tax.\n",
      "5007 They want feminine hygiene products exempted from sales tax, because, like food and prescriptions, they're considered life essentials.\n",
      "5008 Many states have carved out other sales-tax exceptions over the years, often based on local interests or aggressive lobbying.\n",
      "5009 Feminine hygiene products generate an estimated $120 million in sales tax nationally every year, according to Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, an advocate for menstrual policy and the author of the upcoming book \"Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity. \"\n",
      "5010 In 2015, 10 states didn't tax feminine hygiene products, but five of them have no sales tax at all, she added.\n",
      "5011 In 2016, New York, Connecticut and Illinois also nixed their sales tax on tampons, sanitary napkins, menstrual cups and other products; California Gov.\n",
      "5012 Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that would've ended that state's tax on menstrual products.\n",
      "5013 \"The tampon tax was a way to introduce the thinking about the economics of menstruation into the political sphere,\" said Weiss-Wolf, who also called it \"patently unfair. \"\n",
      "5014 Also gaining awareness is the \"Free the Tampon\" movement, which wants products women need for their periods available for free in restrooms managed by governments.\n",
      "5015 Last year, for example, the New York City Council passed legislation which would offer them gratis in public schools, prisons and shelters  \"You've never heard about any talk about the free toilet paper or government-funded toilet paper.\n",
      "5016 The logic is it's a necessity for people whose bodies menstruate, like you have paper towel to dry your hands.\n",
      "5017 We put this in the same category,\" said Weiss-Wolf.\n",
      "5018 \"We all benefit if everyone's functioning optimally, at their best level.\n",

      "5065 Others said the company had long avoided criticism specifically because it was a feminist-minded company run by a female entrepreneur.\n",
      "5066 Holly Grigg-Spall, a writer and women’ health activist who has been on a panel with Agrawal, said she and others had suspicions that things with Agrawal and the company were not as they seemed, but “t was almost a ‘aboo’o speak out against a company that we, as feminists in the menstruation space, were supposed to be grateful for in terms of impact, media coverage, etc.”  “ecause Thinx supposedly promotes feminist messaging, they are being given a pass by some in a way we did not see with Uber, despite some similarities in terms of the CEO’ character and treatment of workers,”rigg-Spall said.\n",

      "5104 Under the Man’ Right to Know Act, Texanmen would be fined $100 for every 'unregulated masturbatory emission'- although they may be reassured to learn thisis a satirical billhighlighting how women have been targeted by anti-abortion laws.\n",
      "5105 A bill that would see Texas men fined $100 (£2) for masturbating has taken a step closer to becoming law after it received its first reading in the state’ House of Representatives.\n",
      "5106 Under section 173.010 of House Bill 4260, the Man’ Right to Know Act, Texas men would only be allowed to masturbate under supervision, inside approved health care and medical facilities.\n",
      "5107 Any “nregulated masturbatory emissions outside of a woman’ vagina, or created outside of a health or medical facility, will be charged a $100 civil penalty for each emission, and will be considered an act against an unborn child, and failing to preserve the sanctity of life.”  The bill, created by state representative Jessica Farrar of Houston, would also promote “ully abstinent sexual relations”nd create a “ospital Masturbatory Assistance Registry”o “rovide fully-abstinent encouragement counselling, supervising physicians for masturbatory emissions, and storage for the semen.”  Read more  11 obscene ways politicians are trying to stop women having abortions  Allowing Texas men only “ccasional”asturbatory emissions inside the approved facilities, the bill would insist that the resulting semen be “tored for the purposes of conception for a current or future wife.”  After receiving its first reading, the bill has now been referred to the Texas House State Affairs Committee.\n",
      "5108 Ms Farrar has proposed that it become law on September 1.\n",
      "5109 But before the men of Texas panic, (or head obediently to their nearest health facility), they should note that Ms Farrar is not being entirely serious.\n",
      "5110 The Texas Democrat knows her bill has no hope of becoming law, and has introduced it to satirise how women have been affected by targeted healthcare legislation in her state, particularly relating to abortion.\n",
      "5111 Hence the references to “anctity of life”nd anti-masturbation clauses that appear to take Monty Python’ advice that “very sperm is sacred”o its logical, legal conclusion.\n",
      "5112 Her bill, Ms Farrar has claimed, “irrors real Texas laws and health care restrictions faced by Texas women every legislative session.”  Emphasising the need for full male abstinence, it comes three months after Republican Tony Tinderhold proposed criminalising abortion in Texas, arguing it would make women “ore personally responsible” about their sexual behaviour.\n",
      "5113 Ms Farrar’ bill also insists that any doctor providing a vasectomy or prescribing Viagra must first read a ‘an’ Right to Know’ooklet with the patient.\n",
      "5114 This, Ms Farrar has said, is a response to current Texas law which obliges doctors to give women considering an abortion a “omen’ Right to Know”ooklet.\n",
      "5115 Ms Farrar has criticised this as a “uilt mechanism”o get the woman to change her mind.\n",
      "5116 She has also criticised the Texas law requiring a woman to have a trans-vaginal ultrasound before she can have an abortion as an “nvasive, medically unnecessary procedure [where] one of the state's objectives is to guilt her into changing her mind.\"\n",
      "5117 Read more  An anti-abortion group is being given £50,000 from the Government  Outrage after tampon tax money is used to fund anti-abortion charity  The horrific reality of having an illegal abortion in the 1960s  So her bill also insists: “n attending physician must administer a medically-unnecessary digital rectal exam and magnetic resonance imagining of the rectum before administering an elective vasectomy or colonoscopy procedure or prescribing Viagra.”  When in less satirical mood, Ms Farrar has previously sought to abolish the death penalty in Texas and is currently trying to get a bill passed that would require healthcare facilities to provide information on emergency contraception to sexual assault survivors.\n",
      "5118 The near-impossibility of her satirical Man’ Right to Know bill becoming law is underlined by the fact that for it to pass, the Texas House State Affairs Committee chairman, Republican Byron Cook, would have to hold a public hearing on the measure.\n",
      "5119 Which is unlikely given that Mr Cook has filed or supported some of the bills criticised by Texas abortion rights activists.\n",
      "5120 For Ms Farrar, though, that might just sharpen the satire.\n",

      "5146 Unlike candy bars, frozen dinners and eye shadow, tampons and menstrual pads are not required to carry a list of ingredients.\n",
      "5147 Instead, many tampon makers give a suggested ingredient list saying their product “ay”ontain cotton or rayon or polyester, or possibly a combination of them.\n",
      "5148 And many sanitary pads, don’ list any ingredients at all on the package, though companies may offer information on their websites, noting that the pads contain materials like “bsorbent wood cellulose”nd polyolefin, a chemical compound.\n",
      "5149 Now a vocal group of health activists focused on “enstrual equity”re calling for new rules to force companies to disclose the chemicals and materials used to manufacture feminine care products.\n",
      "5150 “ call this ‘he other tampon tax,’”aid Laura Strausfeld, co-founder of Period Equity, a law and policy institute focused on menstrual equity issues, referring to a lack of transparency that prevents women from knowing exactly what’ in an intimate product, with potential consequences for their health.\n",
      "5151 Until just a couple of years ago, the subject of menstruation wasn’ discussed in mixed company.\n",
      "5152 Women kept tampons out of sight, and girls used code language to refer to their periods.\n",
      "5153 But over the past few years, activists have attempted to normalize the subject of monthly periods.\n",
      "5154 They have called for an end to sales tax on sanitary products in some states, and pushed to make feminine products free in schools and homeless shelters.\n",
      "5155 Now activists are calling for more scrutiny of the manufacturing process of a consumer product used by a woman for about a week out of every month of her childbearing years.\n",
      "5156 Earlier this month, Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of New York, introduced a bill called the Menstrual  Products Right to Know Act, which would require menstrual hygiene products —ncluding tampons, pads, and menstrual cups –o list their ingredients on the package.\n",
      "5157 On Tuesday, members of Women’ Voices for the Earth, a nonprofit organization whose 2013 report “hem Fatale,”ocused on toxic chemicals in feminine care products, rallied in Washington to express their support for the proposed legislation.\n",

      "5160 The prospects for both bills most likely are dim, given the complicated legislative agenda and divisive political climate.\n",
      "5161 But proponents are convinced that the proposed legislation and rallies can leverage public support for the changes, and put pressure on tampon and pad makers to disclose ingredients and ensure their products are safe for women.\n",
      "5162 “e want women to be able to know what chemicals are in these products, which come in direct contact with our bodies,”aid Ms. Meng.\n",
      "5163 The Food and Drug Administration regulates menstrual hygiene products as medical devices, a category that also includes dental floss and condoms.The agency recommends manufacturers provide general information on the label about the material composition of the product –uch as whether the product is made of cotton or rayon —ut does not require the individual ingredients, said Deborah Kotz, an F.D.A.\n",

      "5165 “isclosure of ingredients in pads and tampons right now is entirely voluntary,”aid Sarada Tangirala, the national campaigns manager for Women’ Voices for the Earth.\n",
      "5166 There are two types of ingredients that most interest women’ health activists.\n",
      "5167 One category is added ingredients like fragrances, gels and other additives, including those used to enhance absorbency or provide adhesives for pantyliners.\n",
      "5168 The other category includes incidental contaminants that may be toxic, such as persistent pesticide residues in cotton or toxic byproducts created during the manufacturing process.\n",
      "5169 One longtime concern about menstrual products has been whether the process of purifying or bleaching cotton and rayon with chlorine compounds may leave worrisome traces of toxic dioxins behind.\n",
      "5170 Some research in nonhuman primates has linked exposure to dioxins to endometriosis.\n",
      "5171 But several other studies of dioxin content in different brands of tampons and disposable diapers found no evidence of the most toxic dioxin, and reported that other dioxin exposures were of a magnitude thousands of times smaller than exposures that occur routinely through the diet.\n",
      "5172 The F.D.A.\n",
      "5173 has also analyzed dioxin content in tampons in the past and determined that for the average woman, the typical monthly exposure from tampons does not exceed tolerable levels set by the Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives, though the amounts that were detected varied between tampon brands and types.\n",
      "5174 Several large manufacturers say the issue is moot because they have abandoned the use of chlorine in the purification process.\n",
      "5175 Both Procter & Gamble, maker of Always and Tampax, and Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kotex, state on their websites that they use a process called elemental chlorine-free bleaching, which does not create dioxins during the bleaching process.\n",

      "   Florida Enacts Legislation Reducing Commercial Rent Tax Rate, Amending Sales Tax And Other Provisions  Rob Clarke  2,231 words 7 August 2017 Mondaq Business Briefing BBPUB English (c) 2017 Mondaq Ltd   On May 25, 2017, Florida Governor Rick Scott signed legislation adopting the reduction of the state's sales tax on non-residential leases and licenses of real property.1 The rate is reduced from 6 percent to 5.8 percent effective July 1, 2017, and may decrease further in the future.\n",
      "5308 Several provisions, mainly relating to sales tax exemptions for data center property and other items, were also included in the legislation.\n",
      "5309 Commercial Rent Tax  Background  For nearly 50 years, Florida has imposed a sales tax on \"renting, leasing, letting, or granting a license for the use of any real property.\n",
      "5310 \"2 Specifically exempted from the tax are certain property types, such as property used exclusively as dwelling units.3 The tax historically has been imposed at a state rate of 6 percent plus any applicable local surtaxes.4 The tax applies not only to base rents, but to additional fees paid pursuant to a lease or license agreement, such as common area maintenance fees, ad valorem taxes, insurance premiums, and other additional rents.5 The tax also has wide application, being applied not only to conventional leases for buildings and land, but also to arrangements where the owner of a kiosk or equipment pays fees to the owner of property pursuant to a revenue sharing or commission agreement (e.g., revenue sharing consideration paid by owners of ATMs, coin-operated vacuums, sales booths, etc., to the businesses where such items are located).6 Florida is the only jurisdiction to impose a state-level tax on leases or licenses to use real property, but New York City imposes a local-level tax.7  Rate Change and Proposals  The legislation reduces the commercial rental tax rate from 6 percent to 5.8 percent, beginning on July 1, 2017.8 The law also includes a timing provision, clarifying that the rate applicable to any commercial lease will be the rate in effect at the time that a tenant or person is entitled to occupy or use the real property, not the date on which the rent or fee payment is due or paid.9  Data Center Property Sales Tax Exemption  Similar to legislation adopted by numerous states in the last several years, Florida is encouraging the development of data centers in the state through broad sales tax exemptions for property used exclusively in data center operations.10 Data center property eligible for the exemption includes construction materials, components, machinery, equipment, computers, servers, installations, redundancies and software, as well as electricity used exclusively at the data center.11 To be eligible for the sales tax exemption on data center property, the owners and tenants of the data center must invest at least $150 million for the data center, and the data center must have a critical IT load12 of at least 15 megawatts (with at least 1 megawatt dedicated to each individual data center owner or tenant).13  The exemption from sales tax may be taken once a temporary tax exemption certificate is applied for, and issued by the Florida Department of Revenue.14 These eligibility requirements must be met no later than five years after construction of the data center begins.15 If these requirements are not met, a recapture provision applies to the sales tax that was not paid on the data center property, along with the imposition of applicable interest and penalties.16 Temporary tax exemption certificates may not be issued by the Department after June 30, 2022.17  Other Sales Tax Exemptions  The legislation contains numerous sales tax exemptions, the most significant of which are listed below:  Effective July 1, 2017, certain building material purchases, rentals of tangible personal property, and pest control services used in new construction in \"rural areas of opportunity\" (as designated by Governor Scott) are exempt.18 The exemption is claimed through a refund of paid taxes, in an amount of up to $10,000 per parcel of real property.19  Effective July 1, 2017, certain animal health products for the benefit of livestock or poultry, along with aquaculture health products used by aquaculture producers to prevent disease are exempt.20  A back-to-school sales tax holiday will occur from August 4-6, 2017, during which certain clothing, school supplies and personal computers will be exempt.21  Effective January 1, 2018, tampons and similar products will become exempt.22  Corporate Tax Filing Extensions  Corporate taxpayers that are granted federal income tax return filing extensions and comply with the estimated payment rules automatically receive six-month Florida extensions.23 However, a recent amendment to this provision provided corporate taxpayers (for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2026) with a seven-month extension if their tax year ended on June 30, and a five-month extension if their tax year ended on December 31.24 Effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, the legislation eliminates the five-month extension reference, effectively allowing December 31 year-end taxpayers a six-month extension.25  Community Contribution Tax Credit (CCTC)  Special benefits are available through the CCTC to persons that make certain donations (community contributions) made for use in certain projects that benefit persons with special needs, as well as low-income households.26 The CCTC may be taken as a refund against state sales and use taxes, corporation income taxes, or insurance premiums taxes.\n",
      "5311 While the CCTC sunset date of June 30, 2018 has been eliminated, ensuring that the program will remain in effect indefinitely, the total amount of tax credits available under the CCTC program will be reduced from $21.4 million in Florida's 2017-18 fiscal year to $14 million in future fiscal years.27  Commentary  The commercial rental tax is estimated to generate approximately $700 million annually, and as such, attempts to reduce or eliminate this large revenue stream have been met with resistance.\n",
      "5312 However, Governor Scott has deemed Florida's tax on commercial rentals and leases an \"unfair tax,\" as Florida is the only state to collect this type of sales tax.\n",
      "5313 Governor Scott has previously called for the elimination of the tax, and in prior legislative sessions, he has asked the Florida legislature to reduce the rate of the tax by 0.5 percent.\n",
      "5314 In addition, lawmakers have undertaken independent efforts to chip away at the tax, some through a one-time rate reduction to 5 percent, and others by phasing out the tax over a decade.28 Likewise, certain industry groups representing builders, contractors, realtors, retailers, restaurants, and lodging establishments have been supportive of these efforts,29 as the tax has been accused of hurting small businesses and creating a disincentive for companies to do business in Florida.30  At this point, it is unclear whether the commercial rent tax rate reduction adopted in this legislation is an isolated change or whether it may signal the beginning of the end for Florida's tax on commercial rents.\n",
      "5315 There are questions as to whether repealing the tax would have a significant impact on Florida's economic environment.\n",
      "5316 For instance, a 2014 report by the Office of Economic and Demographic Research suggested that the tax may not have much impact on the state's business climate, specifically noting that \"[s]ince the leasing market has demonstrated a history of growth and manageable vacancies over the long run, it is unlikely on its face that the rental tax has materially driven a significant number of the economic actors into other paths.\n",
      "5317 \"31 According to the report, such alternative paths would be demonstrated by private ownership in lieu of leasing by potential tenants, or alternative investments in lieu of the expansion of leasing stock.\n",
      "5318 \"By most accounts, [however], the commercial leasing industry in Florida is robust relative to many other states.\n",
      "5319 \"32  The report also cites other studies finding that \"Florida had average to above average per capita levels of office and retail space, and was on par with Texas with industrial space,\" and near the start of the decade, \"South Florida, Orlando and Tampa [ranked] among the top 20 most active U.S. markets for commercial real estate.\n",
      "5320 \"33 Additionally, the tax has been in place for nearly 50 years, so \"the market has fully adjusted to its existence and has moved to a post-tax equilibrium.34  Given the uncertainty of the economic effect of the commercial rental tax, some Florida lawmakers will undoubtedly continue to push for repeal of the tax.\n",
      "5321 However, these lawmakers may not continue to receive the same degree of support from the next Florida governor, since Governor Scott is term-limited and will soon be out of office.\n",
      "5322 The agenda of the state's incoming executive and the position of the state's treasury will likely determine the extent to which repeal of the tax will be pursued by the legislature in future sessions.\n",
      "5323 Beyond the commercial rental tax reduction, the legislation provides significant benefits for companies that want to locate their data center operations in Florida.\n",
      "5324 Further, the legislation could incentivize economic development in the form of new construction in the rural areas of opportunity that are designated by Governor Scott.\n",
      "5325 The continued availability of the CCTC likely will encourage economic development efforts.\n",
      "5326 Finally, the ability to take advantage of the upcoming back-to-school sales tax holiday and the prospective elimination of the \"tampon\" tax will be welcomed by Florida residents.\n",

      "5447 All rights reserved.\n",
      "5448 Efforts in an increasing number of states to repeal tampon taxes represent one of the most misguided, falsely advertised and phony policy reform movements in recent history.\n",
      "5449 For starters, there is no such thing as a “tampon tax.\n",
      "5450 ”here is not a single state, locality or other governing entity in the United States that imposes a special or discriminatory tax on tampons.\n",
      "5451 “Tampon tax”epeal bills, whose introduction has become a recent fad in many state legislatures, merely seek to exempt tampons and other feminine hygiene products from the state sales tax that is applied to most goods and certain services.\n",
      "5452 In 2016, 13 states considered legislation that would exempt tampons and feminine hygiene products from state sales tax.\n",
      "5453 The District of Columbia and three states - ew York, Illinois, Connecticut - ltimately approved such exemptions last year.\n",
      "5454 It’ not just blue state Democratic strongholds that are passing these measures.\n",
      "5455 In May of this year, Florida joined their ranks when it enacted a new law to exempt tampons from state sales tax, making it 14 states that now do not apply sales tax to feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "5456 Florida’ exemption will take effect in January, whereas Connecticut’ will become effective une 2018, and Washington, D. C. ’ comes online in October 017.\n",
      "5457 More: Tax Day isn't likely to be easier next year: Bill Sternberg  More: Tax reform's secret sauce for boosting economic growth  As Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the non-partisan Tax Foundation, explains, this “tampon tax”epeal movement tries to sell bad fiscal policy with false advertising:  “upporters of ‘tampon tax’epeal bills argue that women face an injustice when buying these necessity items, but that argument doesn’ hold water.\n",
      "5458 First, it’ factually inaccurate - no state subjects tampons to a special or unique tax.\n",
      "5459 Second, the solution - exempting tampons and other feminine hygiene products from the sales tax   violates the principles of sound tax policy.\n",
      "5460 Ideally, sales taxes should tax all final consumer purchases, without regard to whether items are classified as necessities or luxuries…xempting feminine hygiene products from the sales tax base results in less revenue for state coffers, leading to higher overall rates in the long run.\n",
      "5461 ”  These misleadingly named “tampon tax”epeal bills have been pushed predominantly by Democratic state lawmakers, progressive policy analysts and left wing pundits.\n",
      "5462 What’ clear is that these proposals are a political ploy meant to portray Democratic politicians who are normally hard-pressed to name a tax hike they’ oppose as being in favor of tax relief.\n",
      "5463 Democrats getting on the “tampon tax”epeal train think they can portray themselves as pro-tax relief, while painting Republicans who oppose the new carve out as anti-woman.\n",
      "5464 Clever plan.\n",
      "5465 Unfortunately for those adopting it, the current national debate over repealing and replacing Obamacare shows how these “tampon tax”epeal proposals are nothing more than cynical political posturing and that it is Democrats, not Republicans, who are pushing anti-woman policies.\n",
      "5466 POLICING THE USA:  ook at ace, justice, media   More: Supreme Court imposes church tax  Obamacare, passed with only Democrat votes, includes 20 tax increases, many of which harm women in particular.\n",
      "5467 Take Obamacare’ Medicine Cabinet Tax, which hits 20 million Americans with Health Savings Accounts and 30 million Americans with Flexible Spending Accounts.\n",
      "5468 This tax hike could also be dubbed the Menstrual Cramp Tax, as it raises the cost of Midol and similar products that women rely on.\n",
      "5469 Republicans in Congress have voted numerous times to repeal this anti-woman $5.\n",
      "5470 6 billion tax hike.\n",
      "5471 Senators Chuck Schumer, Dick Durbin and other Democrats have opposed them every step of the way and continue to do so.\n",
      "5472 Republicans have also called for repeal of Obamacare’ tax on prescription medicine, which raises the cost of birth control, along with other pharmaceuticals that women rely on.\n",
      "5473 Yet Democrats continue to oppose efforts to repeal this anti-woman tax hike.\n",
      "5474 Speaking of birth control, many prominent Republicans - uch as Senator Corey Gardner (R-Colo. ) and former Louisiana Gov.\n",
      "5475 Bobby Jindal - ave proposed making birth control available over-the-counter without a prescription.\n",
      "5476 Democrats like to grandstand about access to birth control, yet they oppose this commonsense proposal from conservative Republicans to make it more accessible and less costly.\n",
      "5477 The other 18 tax hikes in Obamacare also adversely affect women, yet Democrats strongly oppose Republican efforts to repeal them.\n",
      "5478 Democrats will continue to feign concern about women by introducing tampon sales tax exemption bills in state capitals.\n",
      "5479 Yet their support for massive national tax increases that do great harm to women, along with Democratic opposition to over-the-counter birth control exposes the “tampon tax”epeal movement as a political stunt meant to conceal and distract from anti-women policies being pushed by the modern Democratic Party.\n",
      "5480 2016 proved that voters are smarter than Democratic political operatives think.\n",
      "5481 Apparently that lesson hasn’ been learned.\n",

      "5487 Periods are interesting to me.\n",
      "5488 For 22 years, I've been thinking about them, reading about them, collecting trivia about them, boring folks at dinner parties about them and writing articles about them —eginning with a 1995 cover story in the Village Voice about the menstrual-products industry.\n",
      "5489 The alternative newspaper scandalized sophisticated New Yorkers by putting on its cover an image of a tampon string peeking from between a woman's thighs.\n",
      "5490 After two decades, I remain obsessed with menstruation as a window on our culture's lack of respect for women's bodies and reproductive rights, and its misunderstanding of consumerism and advertising.\n",
      "5491 So it was with tremendous pleasure that I heard of Jennifer Weiss-Wolf's new book, \"Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity.\"\n",
      "5492 Weiss-Wolf argues that menstrual equity is a gateway issue for feminists.\n",
      "5493 \"In order to have a fully equitable and participatory society,\" she writes, \"we must have laws and policies that ensure menstrual products are safe and affordable and available for those who need them.\"\n",
      "5494 Weiss-Wolf, a lawyer who works at the Brennan Center for Justice, is the force behind the fight to eliminate a sales tax on tampons.\n",
      "5495 She has also drawn attention to the plight of homeless women, girls in developing countries and female inmates, all of whom have difficulty getting the menstrual products they need.\n",
      "5496 Weiss-Wolf contends that the tampon tax amounts to a \"pink tax\" on women.\n",
      "5497 Some states that charge sales tax exclude necessities such as food and medicine.\n",
      "5498 Tampons and pads, by comparsion, are taxed 4 to 10 percent.\n",
      "5499 Thanks in part to Weiss-Wolf's efforts, 13 states have scrapped the sales tax on tampons, and legislatures in many other states are weighing similar action.\n",
      "5500 Weiss-Wolf has joined with other activists in advocating for better Food and Drug Administration oversight of menstrual products.\n",
      "5501 For instance, manufacturers are not required to list components on packages.\n",
      "5502 While they must record \"adverse events\" related to product use, Weiss-Wolf points out that since \"they don't have to share internal studies or research with anyone outside the FDA, we've got no recourse for getting a second opinion.\"\n",
      "5503 \"Periods Gone Public\" catalogues almost everything on the menstrual landscape, making the book an invaluable resource, if not a riveting read.\n",
      "5504 However, Weiss-Wolf stumbles in places.\n",
      "5505 Her discussion of efforts to provide disposable products to women in developing countries overlooks some environmental concerns and the blatant market-driven motivations behind some social entrepreneurs.\n",
      "5506 And her embrace of a movement that she believes will improve the workplace ignores some scary implications.\n",
      "5507 The Red School movement offers what it thinks is a visionary approach to menstruation.\n",
      "5508 In this brave new work world, Weiss-Wolf writes that employees would be \"offered an opportunity to chart their cycles\" and \"assess its impact on work habits and best practices.\"\n",
      "5509 She suggests that this knowledge, including insights like \"I am lethargic and irritable for two days before my period,\" could \"provide guidance for customizing scheduling and assignments.\"\n",
      "5510 In July 2016, Fast Company wrote about one office that is already doing that.\n",
      "5511 Thinx, the maker of \"period panties for modern women,\" posts menstrual charts indicating where each employee is in her cycle.\n",
      "5512 \"Coworkers are aware when a team member is experiencing premenstrual tension or is likely to have cramps,\" reporter Elizabeth Segran wrote.\n",
      "5513 \"In an ideal situation, they can be more sympathetic to one another.\n",
      "5514 They believe that this approach actually makes everyone more productive.\"\n",
      "5515 Weiss-Wolf describes this as \"menstrutopia.\"\n",
      "5516 I see it rather as a menstrual dystopia of \"Handmaid's Tale\" proportions, where women are reduced to the sum of their publicly chronicled cycles, hemmed in by predictive notions about their efficacy in the workplace at any given time, their emotional fortitude and their fluctuating value in the marketplace based on the state of their hormones.\n",
      "5517 Dicey science has long been used to evaluate women's abilities in the workplace.\n",
      "5518 During World War II, the government created instructional films for members of the Women's Army Corps and female workers that cited scientific evidence that periods are \"no excuse for absenteeism and self-coddling.\"\n",
      "5519 Postwar studies purported to show a woman's infectiveness during her menstrual cycles.\n",
      "5520 As recently as 1995, when the nation debated women in combat, then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich alluded to the dangers of menstruation and warned about a female soldier's life in a combat ditch, saying that \"females have biological problems staying in a ditch for thirty days because they get infections and they don't have upper body strength.\"\n",
      "5521 Many programs to foster menstrual awareness in the workplace and elsewhere are driven by the corporate world.\n",
      "5522 Weiss-Wolf casts many small, innovative start-ups in the developing and developed world as allies in the battle to eliminate the stigma and shame associated with monthly bleeding.\n",
      "5523 And large companies such as Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson are seeking major inroads in the developing world.\n",
      "5524 I have little faith in hitching the menstrual wagon to corporate stars in hopes that they will drive an enlightened movement.\n",
      "5525 \"As long as you're promoting products, you're not addressing the stigma of menstruation —ou're helping menstruators hide their menstruation more efficiently,\" says Christina Bobel, an associate professor of women's and gender studies at the University of Massachusetts and president of the Society for Menstrual Cycle Research.\n",
      "5526 Fortunately, despite its flaws, \"Periods Gone Public\" is a rich picture of the current menstrual landscape —nd a promising call to smart activism.\n",

      "5529 Normally, the email bulletins sent from the Florida Department of Revenue are dry and uninspiring.\n",
      "5530 You have to be a tax wonk to care.\n",
      "5531 And even then, maybe not.\n",
      "5532 Recently, the department has issued guidance on such topics as:  \"Payments for the Purchase and Lease of Items Used for the Operation or Maintenance of a Municipally-Owned Golf Course\" and another gem about \"the indexed tax on asphalt.\"\n",
      "5533 And who could forget the \"2017 Governmental Leasehold Intangible Tax Valuation Factor Table\"?\n",
      "5534 So it was with considerable surprise that I found myself captivated this month by the subject line of a Florida Department of Revenue \"Sales Tax TIP.\"\n",
      "5535 Here's what it said: \"Sales of Products Used to Absorb Menstrual Flow -- Corrected.\"\n",
      "5536 Whoa.\n",
      "5537 Not reaching for the delete key on this one.\n",
      "5538 I was fully absorbed.\n",
      "5539 For starters, I wasn't aware that there was some kind of malfunction involving products used to absorb menstrual flow.\n",
      "5540 These products were later defined as \"tampons, sanitary napkins, panty liners, and menstrual cups.\"\n",
      "5541 And what exactly is a menstrual cup?\n",
      "5542 I would have guessed that was the name of the trophy won by the best college softball team.\n",
      "5543 One of my readers, Jane Irion, was equally intrigued, and figured out correctly that I was just the sort of person who'd be willing to sort through the bloated bureaucracy of government publications to figure out what's going on.\n",
      "5544 She surmised that a bunch of \"bleeding hearts\" in Tallahassee must be behind this as a way of placating women.\n",
      "5545 \"Perhaps this incredible tax break will help our state entice a younger, female demographic to relocate to Florida,\" she said.\n",
      "5546 Jane's hunch was correct.\n",
      "5547 This was about a new tax break.\n",
      "5548 \"What's next, tax-free condoms?\"\n",
      "5549 Jane went on.\n",
      "5550 \"That doesn't have a ring to it ... well, um ... yes, a literal ring, but you know what I mean.\"\n",
      "5551 Slow down, Jane.\n",
      "5552 I'm the guy who's supposed to do the jokes here.\n",
      "5553 You're cramping my style.\n",
      "5554 The Florida Department of Revenue TIP -- Was it an applicator TIP?\n",
      "5555 -- was issued because the soon-to-be-enacted tax break on women's hygiene products was entered incorrectly into the Florida Statutes as Section 212.08(7)(ooo), when it should have been section 212.08(7)(nnn).\n",
      "5556 You see, that's the kind of excruciating tedium you can glean from digging into a Florida Department of Revenue alert.\n",
      "5557 Excuse me while I lie down with a cool washrag on my forehead for a moment.\n",
      "5558 Thanks for being patient.\n",
      "5559 I'm back.\n",
      "5560 Anyway, this all has to do with a legislative initiative in Florida to end what is known as the Tampon Tax.\n",
      "5561 Earlier this year, Gov.\n",
      "5562 Rick Scott signed a bill that would make feminine hygiene products tax free in Florida starting in 2018.\n",
      "5563 Scott and the other men who run the state Legislature have been in a goodies-for-all mood in anticipation of this upcoming election year.\n",
      "5564 Scott's looking to jump from the Governor's Mansion to the U.S. Senate, while House Speaker Richard Corcoran has been eyeing Scott's place in the governor's office, along with Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Jack Latvala, before he got demoted due to sexual harassment allegations.\n",
      "5565 So the legislative mood from the usually tight-fisted conservatives has been to shower everyone with their beneficence in anticipation of next year's election.\n",
      "5566 Scott released an $87.4 billion budget earlier this month that boosts spending on items he normally would cut: public schools, environmental projects, and new slots for 565 state workers.\n",
      "5567 Businesses are slated to get $43.1 million in tax incentives.\n",
      "5568 The state's tourism organization, Visit Florida, is slotted for $100 million.\n",
      "5569 And the state's drivers would get a cut in the annual registration fees they pay for their vehicles.\n",
      "5570 Florida's women?\n",
      "5571 They're getting tax-free Kotex.\n",
      "5572 Further evidence that politics is a blood sport.\n",
      "5573 Florida will be the 14th state to eliminate the tax on feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "5574 The change is made by reclassifying the products as a \"common household remedy.\"\n",
      "5575 It's estimated to save Florida's women $11 million a year.\n",
      "5576 Jane thinks it might help to bring younger women to the state.\n",
      "5577 But that would take getting the word out in some kind of advertising campaign to the 36 states where women still pay tax on these products.\n",
      "5578 Our state would need a catchy slogan to lure the women here.\n",
      "5579 How about this?\n",
      "5580 \"Florida: for the time of your life -- or the time of your month.\"\n",

      "5585 Jennifer Weiss-Wolf argues that menstruation is the reality of women’ lives for most of their lives, and society should recognize that—eriod  While on a whirlwind tour for her new book, activist Jennifer Weiss-Wolf found herself suddenly stopped in her tracks in a Dallas, Texas, airport bathroom.\n",
      "5586 The sight in front of her was common enough: a metal, hands-free paper towel dispenser, its contents available at no cost.\n",
      "5587 And nearby, a tampon and pad dispenser—ith a fee.\n",
      "5588 If Weiss-Wolf hadn’ thought much about this palpable contrast before, she certainly was now.\n",
      "5589 “hy is one free and one not?”he asked.\n",
      "5590 “ho decided it and why?”  A lawyer and vice president of think tank Brennan Center for Justice, Weiss-Wolf first paid attention to equal access to menstrual products back in 2015 when she heard about two teenagers in her community collecting pads and tampons for a local food pantry.\n",
      "5591 Periods are part of half the population’ lives, for most of their lives—omething that should be recognized by societal laws and institutions, she believes.\n",

      "5594 Why are our bodies and experiences considered the ‘ther,’”eiss-Wolf ponders.\n",
      "5595 “e have a right to ask systems to account for our bodies and our lives.”  Weiss-Wolf quickly joined the front lines of a movement to end the “tampon tax”—he retail sales tax applied to menstrual products —nd to bring free products to New York City public schools, shelters and prisons, all of which she says is under the umbrella of “enstrual equity.”  Read: New York is the latest state to scrap tampon tax  Weiss-Wolf details those experiences and more in the book “eriods Gone Public,”hich was published Oct. 10.\n",
      "5596 And even though it might seem like women have bigger problems these days amid news of rampant sexual harassment across many sectors, she sees it all as part of a larger, and concerning, theme.\n",
      "5597 Weiss-Wolf spoke with MarketWatch by phone from her office in New York about how to put a value on menstrual equity and what comes after the tampon tax.\n",
      "5598 Following is an edited version of the conversation.\n",
      "5599 MarketWatch: We’e obviously a financial news site.\n",
      "5600 How is this idea of “enstrual equity” financial issue?\n",
      "5601 Jennifer Weiss-Wolf: The equity issue is really rooted in civic participation —he ability to be productive at work, the ability to gain the education we’e entitled to in this country.\n",
      "5602 Women are being denied the ability to participate if they are denied access to menstrual products or can’ afford them.\n",
      "5603 The ability to be present and productive at work and school are economic issues as much as anything else.\n",
      "5604 Women’ economic success is part of global economic success.\n",
      "5605 We have good portion of the population telling us that their ability to sit productively in class is challenged if they don’ have a maxi pad or can’ afford it.\n",
      "5606 It’ not just about the people for whom this ability is being compromised.\n",
      "5607 It’ all of us —e all suffer when women suffer.\n",
      "5608 And when women succeed In the workplace, as parents, as citizens, it’ better for society.\n",
      "5609 Most of us think it’ normal and expected to walk into a public restroom and find toilet paper, soap to wash our hands, something to dry our hands.\n",
      "5610 I’ putting out to the world the idea that menstrual products are also part of that equation.\n",
      "5611 Were we to regulate that provision, we would not only improve the lives of girls and women but we would actually shift that bias and shift what’ considered normal.\n",
      "5612 I’ calling upon our legislators, through this book and this advocacy, to consider menstruation as part of the norm for people who are affected by the laws they pass.\n",
      "5613 Menstruation is a normal bodily function for half of the workforce for a good portion of their lives.\n",
      "5614 And yet we have not treated this as the norm in our lawmaking.\n",
      "5615 It’ to our economic benefit to do so.\n",
      "5616 MW: What would that look like to you?\n",
      "5617 JWW: That’ the fun part of the book.\n",
      "5618 I look at laws through this lens.\n",
      "5619 One example here is flexible spending accounts, which enable us to take care of medical necessities in our lives with tax-free dollars.\n",
      "5620 You can do everything from buying contact lens solution to paying for a doctor’ appointment.\n",
      "5621 But menstrual products you can’, because the IRS tax code doesn’ deem them a medical necessity.\n",
      "5622 Who was at the table making that decision?\n",
      "5623 I imagine anyone who menstruates would probably disagree with that characterization.\n",
      "5624 That’ 30 cents on the dollar I get to save if that rule is shifted.\n",
      "5625 Another example is The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), under the Department of Agriculture, for pregnant women and mothers of babies.\n",
      "5626 It also does not include menstrual products, even though the program focuses more holistically on the health and well-being of new mothers with babies.\n",
      "5627 Women who are postpartum need to use pads, and really giant-sized pads, for about six weeks after childbirth.\n",
      "5628 Yet there’ no analysis or acknowledgment of menstruation or that kind of bleeding in any of WIC’ considerations.\n",
      "5629 WIC has already branched outside of food in the way it manages the program.\n",
      "5630 Why shouldn’ it include menstrual products?\n",
      "5631 MW: Right, and there are plenty of medical conditions with heavy bleeding, like polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis.\n",
      "5632 JWW: All this stuff intersects.\n",
      "5633 It’ not this weird little separate part of our lives, it’ just who we are.\n",
      "5634 It’ part of how we manage our budgets, our schedules and lots of parts of our lives besides access to tampons.\n",
      "5635 Related: This drug may be able to treat both women’ health disorders and prostate cancer  I think the economics of menstruation have only been avoided and ignored because we’e never demanded we put them on the table.\n",
      "5636 There’ a real detriment to ignoring it.\n",
      "5637 MW: What other changes could be made, besides in policy?\n",
      "5638 JWW: All the changes I’ asking lawmakers to make, anybody can make on their own.\n",
      "5639 Employers can make menstrual products available —y employer does, because I brought it to their attention.\n",
      "5640 Any one of us who’ an employee somewhere can remember a time that resulted in a little bit of lost time on the clock, maybe caused you to become a little less productive in a meeting.\n",
      "5641 It’ hard to imagine the cost of providing these products would have an effect on employers’ottom line.\n",
      "5642 Do employers fret about toilet paper costs?\n",
      "5643 MW: So what comes next?\n",
      "5644 JWW: We’e just getting started, there’ so much to do.\n",
      "5645 We’e getting more and more states and municipalities to address this issue of access for vulnerable, or marginalized, or low-income members of their community.\n",
      "5646 With the tampon tax, there were 24 bills introduced —our passed, but there are still 36 states that have the tampon tax.\n",
      "5647 And a broader notion of what it means to make menstruation a focal point of overall legislating.\n",
      "5648 That’ like a lifetime of work to do.\n",
      "5649 I want all our laws to be looked at through this lens, to the extent that it’ practical.\n",

      "5653 NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- It was an end befitting the first Period Con: a congresswoman and a YouTube star shared stories about the first time they menstruated.\n",
      "5654 \"I read 'Are you there, God?\n",
      "5655 It's me, Margaret' by Judy Blume,\" said congresswoman Grace Meng, who represents Queens, New York.\n",
      "5656 \"I think that's what informed me.\n",
      "5657 So when I first got my period, I wasn't scared or didn't know what was happening to me.\"\n",
      "5658 Period Con, held in New York City last month, featured workshops and panels on various menstruation topics, from universalizing access to supplies in the workplace to dispelling the myth periods are dirty or \"unhygienic.\"\n",
      "5659 Meng and YouTube personality Ingrid Nilsen represent two types of so-called period activists.\n",
      "5660 One is an advocate breaking conversational taboos about menstruation.\n",
      "5661 Nilsen creates videos such as \"What Should You Use for Your Period?\"\n",
      "5662 and \"Your Vagina Matters\" for her more than 1 million followers.\n",
      "5663 She famously asked President Obama for his thoughts on the tampon tax.\n",
      "5664 The other is a lawmaker pushing for systemic change.\n",
      "5665 Meng has used her position to push for free menstrual products in jails and homeless shelters in New York City.\n",
      "5666 She also introduced federal menstrual equity legislation earlier this year.\n",
      "5667 Meng said she attributed her initial involvement in the movement to a high school student who wrote her a letter about the lack of menstruation products at homeless shelters.\n",
      "5668 \"She educated me.\n",
      "5669 It seems like such common sense, but maybe if she hadn't written to me or if you hadn't told your friend about this problem, it might not have been fixed,\" Meng told attendees.\n",
      "5670 Period Con is the brainchild of Nadya Okamoto, a 19-year-old Harvard University student.\n",
      "5671 She's also the cofounder of Period, a youth-run global nonprofit that provides menstrual products to those in need.\n",
      "5672 At age 16, Okamoto saw first hand the lack of access to menstrual supplies for the homeless.\n",
      "5673 Homeless herself for a period of time, Okamoto said some people resort to using unsanitary methods such as socks, toilet paper or brown paper bags.\n",
      "5674 That can lead to health issues.\n",
      "5675 Since founding Period in 2014, the organization has given out 190,000 \"period packs\" of supplies with the help of sponsors like U by Kotex, DivaCup and Lunette Cup.\n",
      "5676 About five months ago, she had the idea for Period Con.\n",
      "5677 It came as a way to \"unify\" members across the nonprofit's 130 university chapters in the U.S. She wanted to get the young activists together with academics, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders.\n",
      "5678 For Okamoto, Period Con was the next step to proving the legitimacy of the organization.\n",
      "5679 \"Sometimes I am asked, 'Is your mom helping you with this?'\"\n",
      "5680 Okamoto told CNNMoney.\n",
      "5681 \"We were experiencing quite a lot of ageism, even with older activists.\n",

      "5683 We had to prove our potential.\"\n",
      "5684 In addition to finishing up college and running Period, Okamoto is writing a book about the menstruation movement.\n",
      "5685 It's set to be published by Simon & Schuster in Fall 2018.\n",
      "5686 The event's panels also touched on how brand marketing of period products often reinforce the gender binary.\n",
      "5687 Some activists called on period brands to be mindful of packaging and language used so it is instead reflective of all people who menstruate, including some transgender people.\n",
      "5688 While it's clear that there's a lot of room for progress, keynote speaker Carinne Chambers-Saini -- cofounder of DivaCup, a tampon alternative -- addressed how far the conversation has come.\n",

      "5695 The tax exemptions would expire in 2026.\n",
      "5696 The measure squeaked by the House Ways and Means, 5-4, with the support of two Republicans and all Democrats on the panel.\n",
      "5697 It will also need the approval of the House Health Committee before making it to debate on the floor.\n",

      "5699 Asimilar bill last year passed one committee, but fizzled out before reaching the House floor.\n",
      "5700 This time, Hernandez has three Republican cosponsors: Reps. Drew John, Todd Clodfelter and Michelle Ugenti-Rita.\n",

      "5704 Those nickels and dimes for me and my family, for eight women, could have been another meal or a box of tampons before payday, she said.\n",
      "5705 Dianne Post, an attorney, said the state already exempts sheep, donkeys and lottery tickets, among many other goods, from the sales tax.\n",

      "5707 Daniel Moxley, director of the Diaper Bank of Southern Arizona, said a third of Arizona moms struggle to provide diapers to her kids.\n",
      "5708 Sometimes, people end up reusing disposable diapers when they cant afford new ones, which is a health risk, Moxley said.\n",

      "   Utah lawmakers launch series of family bills  By Sara Israelsen-Hartley Deseret News  884 words 26 January 2018 Deseret News DN English (c) 2018 Deseret News Publishing Co.   By Sara Israelsen-Hartley Deseret News SALT LAKE CITY - In hopes of breaking down barriers to economic progress for Utah families, a bipartisan group of legislators showcased a handful of bills Thursday designed to strengthen families while boosting the state's economy.\n",
      "5728 Thursday's presentation by the Women in the Economy Commission highlighted bills that tackle issues like sales tax on food, family planning services, child care availability, and paid family and medical leave.\n",
      "5729 \"Everybody may not be on the same page with every bill pushed today,\" said commission co-chairwoman Rep. Rebecca Chavez-Houck, D-Salt Lake City, \"but what we are committed to do is create a quality of life (that gives Utahns) an opportunity to succeed and an opportunity to strengthen their families and that all the barriers ...   are removed.\"\n",
      "5730 Salt Lake Chamber officials noted they were \"extremely supportive of the conversation here today,\" and pointed out three bills they consider their top priorities - removing licensing barriers for military spouses, matching the federal tax credit at the state level for companies that provide paid family and medical leave to employees, and enhancing parental access to affordable and quality child care.\n",
      "5731 \"Ultimately our bottom line depends upon the success of our employees and their families,\" said Vance Checketts, general manager and vice president for Dell EMC and chairman of the public policy committee for the chamber.\n",
      "5732 \"It's a huge advantage to individuals, to our businesses and to the state to find a balance between supporting our economy and supporting families.\"\n",
      "5733 Many of the bills listed in the Family Economic Prosperity Priorities list haven't yet been numbered or officially released, but Rep. Susan Duckworth, D-Magna, is hoping that for her bill \"the third time will be the charm.\"\n",
      "5734 Nicknamed the \"tampon tax,\" Duckworth's bill proposes to eliminate the sales tax from baby diapers, adult diapers and feminine hygiene products - products that are crucial for so many families and yet already so expensive.\n",
      "5735 She'll also be chatting with Rep. Tim Quinn, R-Heber City, who wants to drop the 1.75 percent state sales tax on food - a burden he said is disproportionately felt by lower- income families - and instead swap it out for a .24 percent sales tax increase on everything else - except hygiene items, Duckworth hopes.\n",
      "5736 Sen. Todd Weiler, R-Woods Cross, worries that when military officers are transferred to Hill Air Force Base, often for just a few years, their spouses may lose the ability to help provide for their families because of red-tape issues regarding state licensing.\n",
      "5737 If someone is a teacher, or a caregiver for disabled adults or even a private investigator and had been licensed to do that in a different state, it shouldn't take them months or even years to get relicensed here in Utah, he said.\n",
      "5738 Rep. Elizabeth Weight, D-West Valley City, and Rep. Becky Edwards, R-North Salt Lake and co-chairwoman of the Women in the Economy Commission, both talked about bills relating to paid family leave, though Weight's HB156 would provide six weeks of paid leave for state employees, and Edwards' would create a state tax credit for businesses that offer paid family and medical leave to their employees - mirroring what is already available at the federal level.\n",
      "5739 Another bill would address the fact that Utah is one of only seven states that doesn't already provide family planning services to women who fall under the poverty level but don't have insurance coverage, said Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, who added that if \"deep red states in the South have figured this out,\" Utah can, too.\n",
      "5740 His bill, HB12, would provide family planning services to lower-income families through Medicaid for those who fall in the coverage gap - a way to support families that has a definite economic component.\n",
      "5741 Last year, Sen. Ann Millner, R-Ogden, sponsored SB100, a bill to identify all of the resources that are available for parents and their young children.\n",
      "5742 Now, armed with that data, Senate Minority Assistant Whip Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City, Rep. Bruce Cutler, R-Murray, Edwards and Chavez-Houck, want to create real change.\n",
      "5743 Their bills would fund an evidence-based home visiting program for low-income mothers and their children, specifically evaluating mothers for postpartum depression; create an early learning task force that would review current services to make sure that every child is ready for kindergarten; offer tax credits to companies that help their employees pay for child care and create an interagency governing body to coordinate between federal and state efforts to help children up to 5 years old.\n",
      "5744 Sitting off to the side, former Rep. Jennifer Seelig had a hard time containing her excitement as she looked around at the room filling with legislators, lobbyists and community members.\n",
      "5745 Seelig sponsored HB90 in 2014, the bill that created the Women in the Economy Commission, and the day's meeting was a moment of sweet fulfillment.\n",
      "5746 \"I'm just absolutely thrilled that the momentum behind this has continued,\" she said.\n",
      "5747 \"These are data-driven pieces of public policy that benefit all of the state, not only women, but families.\n",
      "5748 I'm seriously stoked.\"\n",

      "5766 People who are unable to have consistent access to menstrual hygiene products have to resort to using items such as rags, newspaper and toilet paper.\n",

      "5821 (CNN) -- Women pressuring T.J. Shope, a Republican Arizona state representative, to push forward a bill that would provide free and unlimited feminine hygiene products to female inmates in Arizona's state prison are sending him -- what else?\n",
      "5822 -- tampons and pads.\n",
      "5823 The bill, introduced by Rep. Athena Salman, was stalled over the weekend by Shope, because the Department of Corrections is currently revising its policy.\n",
      "5824 While it seems that almost any aspect of women's health, especially reproductive health, is always up for national debate, one would think that when it comes to such basic health care for women, aka half of the world's population, people would be in agreement: Women should have access to tampons and sanitary napkins when they have their periods.\n",
      "5825 But in 2018 America, too many women are still being denied their dignity -- often for economic reasons -- during a monthly, natural bodily function, and it's an issue that affects women in and outside the nation's prison system.\n",
      "5826 In Arizona, female prisoners in state and local institutions are allowed 12 free pads each month, and must either ask an officer or pay for any additional supplies.\n",
      "5827 To make matters worse, female prisoners can only possess 24 pads at a time, and there are no free tampons.\n",
      "5828 According to Mother Jones, women in Arizona state prisons would have to work 27 hours to earn the money for a box of tampons.\n",
      "5829 And as any woman who has ever menstruated can tell you, hygiene products are not created equal.\n",
      "5830 Not only is 12 a completely inadequate number of free pads, but having to pay for tampons -- which allow for greater freedom of movement and comfort for many women -- is appalling.\n",
      "5831 Thousands of marginalized American women, especially those who live in poverty, who are homeless, or incarcerated, are unable to afford feminine hygiene products, despite it being a billion-dollar industry in America.\n",
      "5832 To make sanitary products even more inaccessible, about 40 states in the United States (including New York) slap them with a sales tax -- a cost that products deemed \"necessities,\" such as groceries, are exempt from in many states.\n",
      "5833 This is known as the \"tampon tax,\" something Canada has managed to eliminate, while campaigns to get rid of it are underway in the United Kingdom and Australia.\n",
      "5834 Even the United Nations recognizes menstrual hygiene as a public-health and human rights issue, with poor menstrual hygiene being linked to a host of health issues, from cervical cancer to infections when dirty cloths are used in place of sanitary napkins.\n",
      "5835 Jyoti Sanghera, chief of the Human Rights and Economic and Social Issues Section, said the \"stigma around menstruation and menstrual hygiene is a violation of several human rights, most importantly of the right to human dignity, that must be overcome.\"\n",
      "5836 The lack of action on this pressing issue for women's health amounts to a staggering failure to formulate adequate public policy.\n",
      "5837 \"I can't imagine something more uncomfortable than not having the menstrual products you need for your period,\" Salman said on Facebook.\n",
      "5838 \"So my heart goes out to these women.\"\n",
      "5839 Even though the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced last year that female inmates in their facilities would be guaranteed free menstrual products, less than 10% of incarcerated women actually stand to benefit from the policy, because the majority of female prisoners are housed in state and local prisons.\n",
      "5840 States like Maryland and Nebraska have introduced legislation to tackle the disparity between men and women's access to the health care and personal hygiene products they need.\n",
      "5841 Although the majority of inmates are men, the population of female inmates has been steadily growing for decades.\n",
      "5842 According to the Correctional Association of New York, an organization that has monitored conditions in the state's prisons since 1846, and which wrote the report \"Reproductive Injustice,\" the US women's prison population increased by nearly 900% between 1977 and 2013.\n",
      "5843 \"Menstrual hygiene products should not be considered a luxury, and Maryland must do more to prevent dehumanizing situations where women inmates don't have sanitary necessities,\" Maryland Sen. Susan Lee, who is chief sponsor of a bill to help incarcerated women access more hygiene products, told the Frederick News-Post.\n",
      "5844 Lee, a Democrat, introduced the bill last month, and it has bipartisan support from 33 state senators.\n",
      "5845 While it's great news that women state lawmakers are leading the way to change an inexcusable and inhumane law, the fact that women are suffering for such a basic need is a stark reminder of why we need more women in government and in charge of formulating policy that ultimately affects our bodies and our lives.\n",
      "5846 All women and girls in America must have access to feminine hygiene products, inside and outside the country's prison and streets.\n",
      "5847 We must work to remove policies and restrictions that would deny women their dignity, and change domestic policy so sanitary products are affordable and accessible to all.\n",
      "5848 Anything less is just playing politics with women's lives -- every month.\n",

      "5850 In a huge victory for women's equality, D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) included partial funding for the \"tampon tax repeal\" in her proposed fiscal 2019 budget .\n",
      "5851 If the D.C. Council adopts her proposal, women in the District —ho earn just 86 cents to every man's dollar, on average —ill no longer face the added indignity of having to pay tax on menstrual products.\n",
      "5852 The mayor's decision to fund the tampon tax repeal demonstrates her leadership on menstrual equity, an issue that has become a national movement.\n",
      "5853 I founded Bringing Resources to Aid Women's Shelters (BRAWS) in 2015 to address the lack of access to menstrual products many women and girls experience locally.\n",
      "5854 BRAWS is a local nonprofit that collects and distributes menstrual products and new bras and underwear (with tags on) to women in shelters in the District, Maryland and Virginia.\n",
      "5855 Through our work, we became aware of this overwhelming need.\n",
      "5856 In 2016, D.C. Council member Anita Bonds (D-At Large), a leader in the menstrual-equity fight, introduced tampon tax legislation that passed with near-unanimous support.\n",
      "5857 The mayor signed the Feminine Hygiene and Diaper Sales Tax Amendments Act of 2016 on Dec. 6, 2016, subject to appropriation.\n",
      "5858 This means the law cannot be implemented until it is funded.\n",
      "5859 To date, the D.C. Council has failed to fund the law.\n",
      "5860 If fully funded, the law would remove the sales tax from all menstrual products and diapers in the District.\n",
      "5861 The District has an opportunity to be at the forefront on menstrual equity, a key women's movement.\n",
      "5862 Laws and policies our society puts in place should take into account that only one gender menstruates.\n",
      "5863 Women are largely the consumers of menstrual products, and a tax on those products unfairly targets women.\n",
      "5864 Menstrual products are expensive, making them inaccessible to some women with low incomes.\n",
      "5865 That can have a negative impact on their jobs and school performance.\n",
      "5866 The sales tax on these products creates even more of a burden.\n",
      "5867 A woman may use more than 40 pads or tampons over a seven-day period.\n",
      "5868 Women and girls who cannot afford these products may suffer physical and emotional trauma, from vaginal infections to ridicule from classmates or colleagues.\n",
      "5869 Moreover, the 5.75 percent D.C. sales tax, which is applied uniformly on all taxable purchases regardless of income level, is regressive.\n",
      "5870 Families with low incomes pay a larger percentage of their income to sales taxes.\n",
      "5871 Some argue that all consumer purchases should be taxed equally to preserve the tax base.\n",
      "5872 However, the District can afford the relatively minor cost of the tampon tax repeal to ensure its tax code does not unfairly burden women.\n",
      "5873 According to the chief financial officer, the District is projected to collect nearly $88.7 million more revenue than anticipated in fiscal 2019.\n",
      "5874 Menstrual products are exempt from sales tax in at least nine states that have a sales tax.\n",
      "5875 Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have exempted menstrual products from sales tax, while supporting women and proving that gender equity matters.\n",

      "   Sanlam Life Insurance: Pink Tax Causes Financial Pain  Distributed by Contify.com 855 words 23 August 2018 Contify Insurance News ATINNW English Copyright ©018 Contify.com   Aug. 23 -- Basic toiletries, grooming products, medical screenings and haircuts are some of the items that see women spending hundreds to thousands of rands more than their male counterparts.\n",
      "6059 A new survey conducted by leading financial services group Sanlam shows that whereas 93.4% of women claim to spend over R100 on monthly toiletries, only 76% of men do.\n",
      "6060 Even in less expected categories such as medical screening and contraception, women are spending more.\n",
      "6061 Over 30% of women claim to spend over R1 500 per annum on medical screening whereas only 16% of men spend over R1 500 per annum.\n",
      "6062 Contraception spend is also different: the majority of men at 56,4% spend nothing on contraceptives, whilst 51,2% of women purchase contraceptives monthly, with 30% of them spending over R100 a month.\n",
      "6063 And sometimes there is a difference even when the service rendered is similar for both genders: 65% of women spend over R200 for a haircut compared to just 8% of men.\n",
      "6064 Fair?\n",
      "6065 Not really.\n",
      "6066 And much of it comes down to a little known problem called pink tax.\n",
      "6067 Axe the Pink Tax  #Axethepinktax is a movement gaining global traction as increasing numbers of women object to paying more just because they're women.\n",
      "6068 A number of studies have investigated whether women 'pay more for pink', with cursory shelf comparisons between ladies' and men's razors and tees as an affirmative starting point.\n",
      "6069 In light of Women's Month, Sanlam commissioned Imagination Alliance research house to conduct a survey with a sample of 1000 (500 men, 500 women) to delve more deeply into pink tax in SA.\n",
      "6070 Danelle van Heerde, Head of Advice Processes at Sanlam Personal Finance says, \"To drastically oversimplify the situation, women are generally earning less and paying more.\"\n",
      "6071 Code for Africa, a gender pay gap tool based on the World Economic Forum's 2017 Gender Gap Report, found that South African men earn about R6 607.25 more than women monthly.\n",
      "6072 This equates to the sixth largest pay gap in Africa.\n",
      "6073 The research pins multiple factors behind this, including the fact that women tend to work in industries with lower average pay and have commitments like childcare.\n",
      "6074 \"Now add to this the fact that women generally have to pay more than men for basic monthly necessities and one begins to perceive the full spectrum of challenges to women achieving financial independence,\" says Van Heerde.\n",
      "6075 One of the key findings from the survey was that 58% of men agree that women pay more for services and products that are targeted specifically at females.\n",
      "6076 Both men and women believe there are things that they spend money on that the other gender doesn't have to, but significantly more women agree with the statement: 87% of women vs. 59% of men.\n",
      "6077 Making a Difference  Interestingly, there's still very little understanding of the concept of pink tax amongst both genders, although awareness is starting to grow, thanks largely to recent efforts to address the 'tampon tax'.\n",
      "6078 Currently, women are paying the same VAT for tampons and sanitary pads as they would for 'luxury items'.\n",
      "6079 This means these basic necessities suffered the same 15% VAT inflation as other 'luxury items' this year.\n",
      "6080 Sadly, in 2016, UNESCO found that in sub-Saharan Africa, one in 10 girls misses school during her period.\n",
      "6081 This information has spurred many businesses like Sanlam to engage in sanitary product drives to keep these girls in school.\n",
      "6082 And it has prompted Stellenbosch University's law clinic to ask Treasury to place feminine hygiene products on the list of zero-rated VAT items, to eliminate the tampon tax.\n",
      "6083 South African fitness guru, blogger and social media influencer Candice Bodington, partner to Sanlam in the #SanlamPinkTax campaign, says, \"The results of the Sanlam survey shocked me.\n",
      "6084 As a woman, I think we are aware that we are paying more, but not the full extent of it.\n",
      "6085 There's a feeling of outrage and exploitation that deeper knowledge of the pink tax inspires.\n",
      "6086 \"It makes you realise that although our society has come so far, there's still a long way to go.\n",
      "6087 Suffice to say I'm buying blue razors from now on.\n",
      "6088 And I'm going to be using my influence in every way I can to make other women aware, plus the decision-makers who have the power to start to turn this around.\n",
      "6089 Beginning with the tampon tax.\"\n",
      "6090 Her sentiment is echoed by van Heerde, who says Sanlam will be using the survey information to create awareness and encourage women to make the best possible financial decisions in a challenging environment.\n",
      "6091 She concludes, \"For 100 years, we've been helping women to build wealth and achieve financial independence.\n",
      "6092 A big part of this means understanding the unique challenges women face.\n",
      "6093 Women also have a lot of purchasing power and a strong market impact.\n",
      "6094 By providing as much awareness and sound financial guidance as possible, we hope to help women to navigate unique fiscal obstacles like pink tax via informed decision-making.\"\n",

      "6109 A new policy from Virginia’ Department of Corrections that would have required visitors to remove tampons and menstrual cups when visiting the state’ prison inmates was suspended on Tuesday after backlash emerged.\n",
      "6110 “ number of concerns have been raised about the new procedure,”rian J. Moran, Virginia’ secretary of public safety and homeland security, said on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon.\n",
      "6111 The policy would not have taken effect until Oct. 6, but even so, he said, “ feel it appropriate to immediately suspend the newly developed policy until a more thorough review of its implementation and potential consequences are considered.”  A spokeswoman for the corrections department, Lisa Kinney, said in an email that there have been “any instances”here visitors have attempted to smuggle drugs by concealing them in a body cavity, including the vagina.\n",
      "6112 Under the policy, prison facilities had planned to offer pads as an alternative to visitors who were wearing tampons, Ms. Kinney said.\n",
      "6113 Visitors also would have been permitted to instead wear a pad brought from home, she added.\n",
      "6114 Visitors would then have received a body scan, she said.\n",
      "6115 If “otential contraband”as seen during the scan, the visitors would have been given a choice: to get strip-searched or leave without visiting an inmate.\n",
      "6116 “ffenders in Virginia have died of drug overdoses while inside our prisons,”s.\n",
      "6117 Kinney said.\n",
      "6118 “t’ our job to keep the offenders and staff as safe as we can.”  Carla Peterson, the director of Virginia CURE, a prisoner advocacy group that meets frequently with the State Department of Corrections, said in a statement that the group was pleased to hear about the policy reversal.\n",
      "6119 “ur hopes are that more steps and policies that preserve and restore the dignity of persons incarcerated and their families will continue to be taken into consideration,”he said.\n",
      "6120 Reports of the tampon ban began to spread on social media in recent days, creating an outcry among prisoner advocacy groups.\n",
      "6121 “e’e not sure why this policy is needed now,”ill Farrar, a spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia, said earlier on Tuesday in an interview.\n",

      "6123 Farrar said.\n",
      "6124 “o this can have a very negative effect and discourage people from visiting those who are incarcerated.”  When Jana White, a co-founder of the Virginia Coalition for the Fair Sentencing of Youth, found out about the policy, she said on Twitter she was “retty bummed.”  In an interview on Tuesday, she said the policy was “ complete violation of my rights and discriminating against women.”s.\n",
      "6125 White, who has a loved one in prison whom she regularly visits, was jubilant to hear of the reversal, saying, “ur efforts were heard!”  In July, a state law went into effect to provide free feminine hygiene products to female prisoners and inmates.\n",

      "6179 This term is likely one that you've never heard before.\n",
      "6180 I hadn't either, until I attended a discussion hosted by Her Justice, a non-profit that recruits caring, talented attorneys from New York City's law firms, including Proskauer, to provide free legal assistance in the areas of family, divorce and immigration law to women living in poverty, most of whom are victims of domestic violence.\n",
      "6181 At this discussion, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, Vice President for Development and Democracy Fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice, spoke about her advocacy efforts surrounding menstrual equity, including legislation and policies that ensure menstrual products are affordable and available for those who need them.\n",
      "6182 While this topic impacts all women in some way, it most significantly affects incarcerated, homeless, or low-income women and girls.\n",
      "6183 Not only is menstrual equity a hygiene and public health issue, but women and girls often have to compromise their productivity to miss work and school because they cannot afford basic necessities.\n",
      "6184 Weiss-Wolf has worked to increase access to menstrual products through, but not limited to, the following initiatives:  State and Federal Tax Efforts  Most states impose sales taxes, and many of these states exempt health and personal care items from such tax, but only a handful include menstrual products in such exemption.\n",
      "6185 However, within the last two years, lawmakers in many states have introduced bills to remove what is being dubbed the \"tampon tax.\"\n",
      "6186 Supporters of this movement argue that menstrual products are a necessity, and should not be subject to any sales tax.\n",
      "6187 Policy efforts are also underway to push the IRS to amend the tax code so that menstrual products are eligible for reimbursement under flexible spending accounts.\n",
      "6188 Currently, the IRS does not consider tampons or pads medically necessary, despite the fact that the FDA considers such as medical products.\n",
      "6189 Public Accommodations  State and city governments have been active in proposing and passing legislation to achieve menstrual equity.\n",
      "6190 In July 2016, New York City was the first in the nation to pass a legislative package requiring all correction facilities, shelters, and public schools to distribute menstrual products free of charge.\n",
      "6191 Moreover, on the federal level, in July 2017, Senators Booker and Warren introduced the Dignity for Incarcerated Women Act, which among other things, includes a mandate to distribute tampons and pads to inmates.\n",
      "6192 As Weiss-Wolf has argued, there is stigma surrounding the topic of menstruation, but if you think it about it from a human rights perspective, women and girls should not have to miss work or school, risk their health, or compromise their dignity because they menstruate.\n",
      "6193 The solutions Weiss-Wolf has championed seem entirely sensible, yet society has a long way to go.\n",
      "6194 This discussion with Weiss-Wolf was part of the Her Justice \"Breakfast Briefing\" Series, a quarterly conversation for friends, supporters, volunteers and their networks, featuring a diverse array of external influencers who focus on the issues impacting the clients and work of Her Justice.\n",
      "6195 In addition to seeking support from volunteer attorneys who take on pro bono cases, Her Justice also relies on the support of institutional sponsors and partners.\n",

      "6207 You switch on a specific channel at a specific time; you have a standing date to watch a host talk to interesting stars (or make boring stars interesting); you go to bed.\n",
      "6208 So the genre has had an especially tough time adjusting to an era where the TV channel is just one media pathway among many.\n",
      "6209 Who needs a late-night chat with the stars when stars are available on Instagram and Twitter, 24/7 and without intermediation?\n",
      "6210 What is “ate-night”alk on a streaming platform, where, as on a casino floor, neither day nor night exist?\n",
      "6211 I’ not sure anyone really knows the answer, which is why, even as talk shows have multiplied in recent years, many have struggled.\n",
      "6212 But the attempt to figure it out is the most interesting thing about “usy Tonight,”undays through Wednesdays on E!, and “atriot Act with Hasan Minhaj,” Sundays on Netflix.\n",
      "6213 Each is adapting an appointment-TV staple to a phone-scrolling, binge-watching era in a different way.\n",
      "6214 “usy Tonight,”ith the actress and author Busy Philipps, is essentially an answer to the question “hat if Instagram were a TV show?” don’ mean that facetiously.\n",
      "6215 Philipps got the show partly on the strength of her popular Instagram feed, clips from which appear in the credits, festooned with emoji and a cloud of hearts that connote Like, Like, Like.\n",
      "6216 I do like Busy Philipps, and that’ pretty much the price of admission to “usy Tonight.”here other new talk shows often work to introduce the host, this one assumes you’e already a follower, and even consider yourself a virtual pal.\n",
      "6217 There’ no desk; Philipps curls up on the couch, a fellow pop culture junkie sitting down for a night’ TV with you.\n",
      "6218 (“re you eating your kids’andy?”he asked on Halloween night.\n",
      "6219 “re you stealing it and filming it for Jimmy Kimmel?”  “usy Tonight”s a quick half-hour: a round of chat (Philipps uses a trio of her writers as a Greek-chorus collective sidekick), a field piece and a celebrity interview.\n",
      "6220 Philipps is, like Jimmy Fallon but in a different way, an audience surrogate, a fellow fan.\n",
      "6221 She’ not out to pry into her guests but to hang with them.\n",
      "6222 The show is, the cruelly earworm-y theme song reminds you, about “e and my friends.”  Each segment speaks the Instagrammar of enthusiasm.\n",
      "6223 Philipps, in one of her favorite words, is “bsessed”ith lots of things: Steven Tyler, babies, her aunt, the way Vanessa Hudgens tosses her neck in SoulCycle class.\n",
      "6224 [Read about how Philipps has capitalized on her Instagram clout.]\n",
      "6225 Philipps mainly steered clear of politics her first week, something that used to be standard in late night.\n",
      "6226 But there was some personal-as-political —nderscoring how women are still underrepresented in late night —hen she used a graphically funny ramble about menstruation to speak out on a Nevada ballot initiative to repeal the “tampon tax”n feminine hygiene products: “overty is sexist.”  The early question for “usy Tonight”s whether TV — stage in your living room —an reproduce the intimacy of a medium you hold in your hand.\n",
      "6227 Philipps’Instagram stands out partly for its approachable ordinariness, an effect that dissipates when you’e spending half a show talking with celebrities.\n",
      "6228 But Philipps works to connect, ending each episode pouring a margarita, putting on a nightgown —“r.\n",
      "6229 Nightgown,”he calls it —inging a good-night song and saying “ love you”irectly to the camera.\n",
      "6230 “as that just weird?”he said, laughing, during her final signoff of the week.\n",
      "6231 Not necessarily.\n",
      "6232 But it’ definitely more personal than Johnny Carson ever tried to get.\n",
      "6233 “atriot Act”as a different challenge: to make the talk show work on Netflix, despite a dearth of evidence that binge-watchers want it.\n",
      "6234 The streaming outlet has canceled attempts by Chelsea Handler, Joel McHale and Michelle Wolf, while Norm Macdonald and even David Letterman made scarcely a ripple in the vast ocean of binge.\n",
      "6235 Minhaj’ show is modeled less on classical late-night than the thinkpiece-with-jokes format of his fellow “aily Show”lumnus, John Oliver.\n",
      "6236 Like Oliver’ “ast Week Tonight,”inhaj’ show is “alk”nly in the sense that, yes, someone is talking the whole time.\n",
      "6237 The first thing you notice on “atriot Act”s the stage, an alien mother ship of blazing light and geometry that looks, Minhaj pre-emptively jokes, “ike Michael Bay directed a PowerPoint presentation.”he second is Minhaj himself, jittery and pacing, seeming to absorb energy from the jillion-watt setting, his legs spring-loaded.\n",
      "6238 [Read about how Minhaj developed “atriot Act.”]  There is no shortage of news-junkie comics, armed with research and graphics, cracking wise from the left these days.\n",
      "6239 Minhaj’ first two episodes leaned into one thing that sets him apart, his background as a Muslim Indian American and the child of immigrants.\n",
      "6240 His first topic was a recent lawsuit against Harvard’ affirmative-action policy, which seeks to advance a longtime complaint of white activists by leveraging complaints that Asian-Americans have been discriminated against.\n",
      "6241 It’ a subject that’, literally, more than black and white: It involves pitting minority groups against one another, using historical concerns for manipulative ends.\n",
      "6242 Minhaj, bounding between history and pop-culture references, was able to approach the issue as an insider, playing on stereotypes that would be radioactive coming from an outsider.\n",
      "6243 Citing statistics showing that Asian-Americans make up 5.8 percent of the population but over 22 percent of Harvard’ class of 2021, he added: “ut in classic Asian-parent fashion, we’e like, ’wenty-two percent?\n",
      "6244 Why not a hundred percent?’”  Befitting its first topic, “atriot Act”s an example of how hiring talk show hosts other than only white men isn’ just fair; it gives home viewers perspectives, and thus comedy, they wouldn’ get otherwise.\n",
      "6245 (It also represents the audience differently; the studio, in Minhaj’ opening shows, was filled with fans of South Asian descent.)\n",
      "6246 The second episode, pegged to the killing of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, was an overview of Saudi Arabian politics, with detours to critique Indian-American conservatives and the aesthetics of Saudi rap videos.\n",
      "6247 “atriot Act”as a tense, eager vibe, like a student cramming 40-minutes’orth of research into a 20-minute presentation.\n",
      "6248 But it’ possible that its format —ssentially a short, civics lesson standup act —ight ultimately translate better to streaming TV, where people binge on serials but graze at their leisure on episodic nonfiction shows like “ueer Eye” or “alt Fat Acid Heat.”  Minhaj’ early topic selection is similar to Oliver’: drawn from the news but not too perishable.\n",
      "6249 I tend to store “ast Week Tonight”n my DVR, and usually the segments hold up just as well a week or more later.\n",
      "6250 If “atriot Act”an find this sweet spot —rgent but not immediate —t may be a better fit for streaming TV, where you can talk as much as you want, but people don’ listen until they’e ready.\n",

      "6299 And the day after the midterms, the Trump administration issued new rules allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage, despite several pending lawsuits and two federal courts blocking them.\n",
      "6300 This administration and the GOP are ignoring the overwhelming majority of Americans who want access to contraception, abortion, and other modern sexual health services and education.\n",
      "6301 Reproductive freedom isn't controversial; the majority of voters support abortion and over 99% of women ages 15-44 who have had sexual intercourse have used at least one method of contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n",
      "6302 But here we are, in 2018, living in a country without mandatory paid family leave and the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world, home to 15 million children living in poverty and paying mothers less than fathers and women without children.\n",
      "6303 Yet the political party in power, touting \"family values,\" is more focused on curtailing abortion rights, attacking access to birth control, and creating a cultural fissure where one simply does not exist.\n",
      "6304 According to the Pew Research Center, most Americans -- 72% of women and 62% of men -- believe employers should be required to provide birth control coverage in employee health insurance plans.\n",
      "6305 Yet this administration has repeatedly attempted to repeal the birth control mandate initially set by President Barack Obama, first issuing a plan to \"circumvent the mandate\" a year ago.\n",
      "6306 Using pseudo-science and outright falsehoods to justify their continued attack on contraception coverage and access -- from claiming birth control doesn't really reduce unwanted pregnancies and leads to riskier sex, to inflating the so-called \"harms\" of birth control pills -- the Trump administration clearly aims to curtail reproductive freedom not because that's what the majority of Americans want, but because it appeases a religious base that helped elect President Donald Trump in the first place.\n",
      "6307 Trump was previously pro-choice before running for president and becoming aware of the voting power of far-right evangelicals.\n",
      "6308 \"I'm very pro-choice,\" Trump said in 1999 during an appearance on \"Meet The Press.\"\n",

      "6311 If Roe v. Wade falls as the result of Trump's appointed anti-choice judges, abortion will automatically become illegal in both states.\n",
      "6312 This political grandstanding has consequences, of course, and it will be young people, women, trans men and non-binary individuals, and particularly black people and other people of color who pay the price.\n",
      "6313 Limited access to birth control will mean an increase in unwanted pregnancies and, in places where abortion access isn't severely restricted, an increase in the number of people who seek abortion services.\n",
      "6314 In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, teenagers who were given contraception were less likely to get pregnant or have abortions compared to those who did not.\n",
      "6315 The teen birth rate dropped to an all-time low in 2017, and the rates of abortion also dropped to an historic low in the same year, all due to access to increased access to contraception and evidence-based, comprehensive sex education.\n",
      "6316 Experts say those who cannot terminate their unwanted pregnancies due to limited abortion access experience more anxiety, lower self-esteem, and less life satisfaction compared to women who obtain abortion services.\n",
      "6317 Women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty, and according to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, women refused an abortion \"were more likely than those who had an abortion to report not having enough money to cover basic living expenses.\"\n",
      "6318 According to a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics, children who are born to women who were denied abortions are less likely to reach developmental milestones, more likely to live in poverty, and experience significantly less maternal bonding than the children of women who had abortions and were able to start their families when they were ready and willing.\n",
      "6319 Denying access to contraception and abortion services is bad for the mental, physical, and financial health of women and their families, but this administration and the GOP are willing to watch American citizens endure those consequences if it means placating their base and maintaining political power.\n",
      "6320 But we know that Democrats, Republicans, rich, poor, religious, atheist -- everyone has abortions, and everyone knows and loves someone who has had an abortion.\n",
      "6321 Continuing to attack reproductive freedom by blocking abortion access and limiting access to contraception isn't the will of the people, but a priority on the agenda of a small few in positions of power who want to stir widespread anger and deny Americans access to medical care to hold onto that power.\n",
      "6322 In a country already facing so many great divides, we don't need our politicians sowing further division about contraception.\n",

      "6328 Yet two extreme anti-abortion measures passed in Alabama and West Virginia on Election day, both of which could criminalize certain forms of contraception and fertility treatment along with abortion care, if Roe v. Wade is ever struck down.\n",
      "6329 And the day after the midterms, the Trump administration issued new rules allowing employers to deny contraceptive coverage, despite several pending lawsuits and two federal courts blocking them.\n",
      "6330 This administration and the GOP are ignoring the overwhelming majority of Americans who want access to contraception, abortion, and other modern sexual health services and education.\n",
      "6331 Reproductive freedom isn't controversial; the majority of voters support abortion and over 99% of women ages 15-44 who have had sexual intercourse have used at least one method of contraception, according to the Guttmacher Institute.\n",
      "6332 But here we are, in 2018, living in a country without mandatory paid family leave and the worst maternal mortality rate in the developed world, home to 15 million children living in poverty and paying mothers less than fathers and women without children.\n",
      "6333 Yet the political party in power, touting \"family values,\" is more focused on curtailing abortion rights, attacking access to birth control, and creating a cultural fissure where one simply does not exist.\n",
      "6334 According to the Pew Research Center, most Americans -- 72% of women and 62% of men -- believe employers should be required to provide birth control coverage in employee health insurance plans.\n",
      "6335 Yet this administration has repeatedly attempted to repeal the birth control mandate initially set by President Barack Obama, first issuing a plan to \"circumvent the mandate\" a year ago.\n",
      "6336 Using pseudo-science and outright falsehoods to justify their continued attack on contraception coverage and access -- from claiming birth control doesn't really reduce unwanted pregnancies and leads to riskier sex, to inflating the so-called \"harms\" of birth control pills -- the Trump administration clearly aims to curtail reproductive freedom not because that's what the majority of Americans want, but because it appeases a religious base that helped elect President Donald Trump in the first place.\n",
      "6337 Trump was previously pro-choice before running for president and becoming aware of the voting power of far-right evangelicals.\n",
      "6338 \"I'm very pro-choice,\" Trump said in 1999 during an appearance on \"Meet The Press.\"\n",
      "6339 \"I am pro-choice in every respect.\"\n",
      "6340 Trump is now singing a different tune, and along with Vice President Mike Pence, has emboldened anti-choice politicians to introduce, and in some cases pass, an unprecedented amount of anti-abortion legislations -- most recently, the state constitutional amendments passed in West Virginia and Alabama.\n",
      "6341 If Roe v. Wade falls as the result of Trump's appointed anti-choice judges, abortion will automatically become illegal in both states.\n",
      "6342 This political grandstanding has consequences, of course, and it will be young people, women, trans men and non-binary individuals, and particularly black people and other people of color who pay the price.\n",
      "6343 Limited access to birth control will mean an increase in unwanted pregnancies and, in places where abortion access isn't severely restricted, an increase in the number of people who seek abortion services.\n",
      "6344 In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, teenagers who were given contraception were less likely to get pregnant or have abortions compared to those who did not.\n",
      "6345 The teen birth rate dropped to an all-time low in 2017, and the rates of abortion also dropped to an historic low in the same year, all due to access to increased access to contraception and evidence-based, comprehensive sex education.\n",
      "6346 Experts say those who cannot terminate their unwanted pregnancies due to limited abortion access experience more anxiety, lower self-esteem, and less life satisfaction compared to women who obtain abortion services.\n",
      "6347 Women who are denied abortions are more likely to live in poverty, and according to a 2018 study published in the American Journal of Public Health, women refused an abortion \"were more likely than those who had an abortion to report not having enough money to cover basic living expenses.\"\n",
      "6348 According to a study published in the Journal of Pediatrics, children who are born to women who were denied abortions are less likely to reach developmental milestones, more likely to live in poverty, and experience significantly less maternal bonding than the children of women who had abortions and were able to start their families when they were ready and willing.\n",
      "6349 Denying access to contraception and abortion services is bad for the mental, physical, and financial health of women and their families, but this administration and the GOP are willing to watch American citizens endure those consequences if it means placating their base and maintaining political power.\n",
      "6350 But we know that Democrats, Republicans, rich, poor, religious, atheist -- everyone has abortions, and everyone knows and loves someone who has had an abortion.\n",
      "6351 Continuing to attack reproductive freedom by blocking abortion access and limiting access to contraception isn't the will of the people, but a priority on the agenda of a small few in positions of power who want to stir widespread anger and deny Americans access to medical care to hold onto that power.\n",
      "6352 In a country already facing so many great divides, we don't need our politicians sowing further division about contraception.\n",
      "6353 We need them to protect our inalienable right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.\n",
      "6354 Because for so many of us, birth control and abortion are contained in the word liberty.\n",

      "6365 Kenya was the first nation to stop taxing menstrual products, in 2004, in part because millions of Kenyan girls and women cannot afford these products.\n",

      "6367 In the United States, food and prescription medication are not taxed, because they are deemed “ecessary.”  And yet, as Ms. Weiss-Wolf —ho works with lawmakers to introduce legislation and policies to support menstrual equity —uestioned when I spoke to her by phone: Are items like Viagra, Pop-Tarts and Rogaine really “ecessities”  Leaders from some states, like Utah, have shot down efforts to eliminate the tampon tax on grounds that they don’ want to pick and choose what is tax exempt.\n",

      "6411 In the ballot measures that may have the most significant immediate impact on the largest number of people, in Idaho and Nebraska, and Utah, voters expanded Medicaid, boosting the number of states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and bringing health care to an additional nearly half-million people.\n",

      "6557 I mean if your why is that you wanted to make lots of money (which is the reason many articles say is a top reason to be a lawyer), then maybe it will be enlightening to see why you have continued in the profession despite this slight myth or what have you sacrificed for your paycheck.\n",
      "6558 If it was to follow in a family tradition, then maybe look at the differences or similarities, both good and bad.\n",

      "6614 Much of the work around menstrual health is done in developing countries and is typically aimed at educating teenagers on menstrual hygiene management.\n",
      "6615 In 2012, public health professionals gathered to create a common definition of what such programs should entail, said APHA member Marni Sommer, DrPH, MSN, RN, associate professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health.\n",
      "6616 The definition - which Sommer said needs an update to use more inclusive language - is: \"Women and adolescent girls are using a clean menstrual management material to absorb or collect menstrual blood that can be changed in privacy as often as necessary for the duration of a menstrual period, using soap and water for washing the body as required, and have access to facilities to dispose of used menstrual management materials.\n",
      "6617 They understand the basic facts linked to the menstrual cycle and how to manage it with dignity and without discomfort and fear.\"\n",

      "6623 State Rep. Debra Bazemore, a Riverdale Democrat, has proposed that Georgia students learn about the risks of extended tampon use, which can cause toxic shock syndrome.\n",
      "6624 And when girls and women buy tampons and other menstrual products, state Rep. Debbie Buckner doesn't believe they should have to pay a sales tax on them.\n",
      "6625 \"It's a fairness issue,\" said Buckner, a Junction City Democrat.\n",
      "6626 \"And it's a cost issue because women tend to make less then men.\n",
      "6627 It's not a luxury item.\n",
      "6628 Its not a choice.\n",
      "6629 It's a necessity.\"\n",
      "6630 If not used properly, tampons can cause toxic shock syndrome -- a severe bacterial infection with symptoms such as sudden high temperature and vomiting.\n",
      "6631 In extreme cases, it can be fatal.\n",
      "6632 The illness, while rare, can develop when women and girls wear tampons too long during their menstrual cycles.\n",
      "6633 \"It's a real health issue,\" Bazemore said.\n",
      "6634 \"We're dealing with the issue of the chemicals that are being put into the tampons that are actually in your body and can affect you -- and it could be deadly.\"\n",
      "6635 Bazemore filed House Bill 10,which would require that the proper use of tampons and the dangers of toxic shock syndrome be part of Georgia's health and sexual education curriculum.\n",
      "6636 Teachers would decide what age or grade would be best to introduce the topic.\n",
      "6637 Dr. Tamika L. Sea, a Stock-bridge obstetrician/gynecologist, said she thinks the legislation is a good idea.\n",
      "6638 While Sea said women don't need to avoid tampon use, it's important to make sure the products that are used have low absorbency and aren't in place for more than eight hours.\n",
      "6639 \"More education regarding placement, duration and risks in the earlier years of a young woman's menstrual history could also help prevent mishaps in usage and risks of (toxic shock syndrome),\" Sea said.\n",
      "6640 \"Early introduction to education likely would aid in reducing overall prevalence.\"\n",
      "6641 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires tampon manufacturers to print usage guidelines on the box.\n",
      "6642 This is Bazemore's second attempt at adding toxic shock syndrome to the state's health curriculum.\n",
      "6643 When her bill received no traction last year, Bazemore took her suggestion to Deputy Georgia Schools Superintendent Jerry McGiboney.\n",
      "6644 Schools spokeswoman Meghan Frick said McGiboney has spoken with heath curriculum staff to see how best to add toxic shock syndrome to the standards.\n",
      "6645 Still, Bazemore said, she wants an official change to the curriculum.\n",
      "6646 Buckner takes issue with the fact that when tampons, and other menstrual items, are purchased, women and girls pay the 4 percent state sales tax.\n",
      "6647 \"Women are unfairly taxed on an item that there is no male equivalent for,\" Buckner said, adding that other nonprescription medical devices, such as diabetic test strips and insulin syringes, are exempt.\n",
      "6648 The FDA classifies menstrual tampons and pads as medical devices.\n",
      "6649 Buckner said she thinks taxing menstrual products has been an oversight, and she introduced House Bill 8 to rectify things.\n",
      "6650 Ten states have gotten rid of what's been called the \"tampon tax.\"\n",
      "6651 She introduced a similar bill last year, but it went nowhere.\n",
      "6652 Buckner said women have typically had little involvement in deciding which sales-tax exemptions lawmakers approve each year.\n",

      "6800 Arizona lawmakers introduced 1,289 bills this session, but a slew has already been left behind.\n",
      "6801 Proposed bills that never received hearings died silently in the Arizona Legislature this week, the last week for committees to hear bills in their chamber of origin.\n",
      "6802 Among them is the push to repeal legislative immunity, which made headlines when it deliberately stalled in the House because Speaker Rusty Bowers declined to move the measure forward.\n",
      "6803 But other notable legislation, including Arizona’ attempt to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, several criminal justice reform measures, also hit a wall.\n",
      "6804 Red for Ed supporters, however, can rejoice because a series of controversial bills targeting educators had not been assigned to committees yet, spelling their apparent doom.\n",
      "6805 Ideas contained in dead bills could still be revived via amendments later in the legislative process, but their likelihood of success is just as grim.\n",
      "6806 Equal Rights Amendment  Perhaps the most high profile legislation that failed to get committee hearings before the deadline carried national implications for women.\n",
      "6807 Arizona Democrats failed in their third attempt to push the Legislature to vote on ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment, which seeks to amend the U.S. Constitution to bar discrimination on account of sex.\n",
      "6808 The Democrats’ight is part of a decades-old battle that began in 1972, when Congress passed the ERA.\n",
      "6809 In order to be adopted, 38 of the 50 states needed to ratify the measure by 1982 the deadline set by Congress.\n",
      "6810 Decades later, 37 states, with Nevada and Illinois signing on in recent years, ratified the amendment.\n",
      "6811 Arizona could have been the final state to adopt the amendment.\n",
      "6812 Democrats lost a key ally when freshman Sen. Tyler Pace withdrew his support on January 31.\n",
      "6813 Two other Republicans in the chamber had expressed support for the measure, and, along with Tyler’ backing, Democrats would have had the votes to pass ERA in the Senate.\n",
      "6814 In the end, the number of floor votes didn’ matter because the ERA bills never got a hearing in Senate Judiciary, which is chaired by Sen. Eddie Farnsworth.\n",
      "6815 In the House, Bowers never assigned the legislation to a committee.\n",
      "6816 Even if the ERA measure passed the Legislature, the amendment would not automatically be added to the U.S. Constitution because of the 1982 deadline.\n",
      "6817 But Congress or the courts could sort out what happens next.\n",
      "6818 Red for Ed  Tensions were running high in the education community weeks before the legislative session kicked off thanks to a handful of bills viewed as retaliation for last year’ Red for Ed movement.\n",
      "6819 But four of five controversial bills introduced by Republican Reps. Mark Finchem of Oro Valley and Kelly Townsend of Mesa were never even assigned to committees.\n",
      "6820 Their unsuccessful proposals included Finchem’ HB2002 to require an educator code of ethics explicitly prohibiting politicking in school and Townsend’ HB2016, which bars employees from harassing, intimidating or harming parents, students and colleagues; HB2017 to prohibit public schools from closing except during pre-approved breaks or emergencies; and, HB2018 to require the attorney general to investigate school districts or employees that lawmakers allege to have violated state law.\n",
      "6821 Their failure was not enough to end talk of a potential Red for Ed resurgence.\n",
      "6822 One of Townsend’ bills, HB 2015, which seeks to prohibit school district employees from using school resources to espouse a political or religious ideology, was heard and adopted in the House Education Committee, prompting warnings of an aggressive response from K-12 advocates.\n",
      "6823 Criminal justice reform  At least three criminal justice measures will go down without a committee hearing despite bipartisan support.\n",
      "6824 Bills from Republican Reps. Walt Blackman, Tony Rivero and Ben Toma may have been cheered by members of both parties, but they failed to win favor with what Toma described as a “trategic minority.”ouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. John Allen and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Eddie Farnsworth do not support the bills.\n",
      "6825 Blackman’ HB2270 sought to address Arizona’ so-called truth in sentencing requirements.\n",
      "6826 Rivero’ HB2245 would have provided greater discretion to judges to reduce mandatory minimum sentences.\n",
      "6827 And Toma’ HB2362 proposed to give judges discretion to seal defendants’riminal records.\n",
      "6828 All three were assigned to the House Judiciary Committee but were not granted a hearing; Blackman’ bill was additionally assigned the House Public Safety Committee, which also did not hear it.\n",
      "6829 Toma said Allen did not want to hear his bill, a decision that he said came down to Farnsworth’ view of the proposal.\n",
      "6830 Blackman, too, had been told Farnsworth had an unfavorable view of his bill, but received no clear explanation as to why Allen would not entertain it.\n",
      "6831 Tampon tax  A proposal to make feminine hygiene products and diapers tax-free did not receive a vote on the House floor for the third legislative session in a row.\n",
      "6832 But unlike in previous sessions, the bill sponsored this time around by Rep. T.J. Shope, R-Coolidge, was not even assigned to a committee.\n",
      "6833 Rep. Daniel Hernandez, D-Tucson, enlisted Shope to run the bill this year in the hopes of giving it a fighting chance.\n",
      "6834 Hernandez sought the exemption himself in 2017 and 2018.\n",
      "6835 The proposal was heard and approved by the House Ways and Means Committee but did not receive hearings in House Health in 2017 and 2018.\n",
      "6836 Herd immunity  While the Senate and House debated legislation that has been criticized for putting up barriers to vaccinating children, two bills left for dead sought to provide parents easier access to information about the vaccination rate at Arizona schools.\n",
      "6837 Rep. Kelli Butler’ HB2352 and Sen. Juan Mendez’ SB1201 strove for the same common goal: Require schools to post the vaccination rate for their student body on the school’ website.\n",
      "6838 The information is already reported to the Department of Health Services, which has a database of immunization coverage rates broken down by county and by individual schools.\n",
      "6839 The sponsors saw the bills as a way to raise awareness about vaccination, which could be a deciding factor when parents choose which school to send their children to.\n",

      "6906 Having more women in the Legislature also means that more are filing bills that align with their life experiences, said Tracy Adkison, the president of the League of Women Voters of Georgia.\n",
      "6907 \"That's why it's so important to have a government that is reflective of the community that it's serving,\" Adkison said.\n",

      "6914 Ten states have abolished similar taxes.\n",

      "6916 State Senate Majority Leader Mike Dugan said while he's noticed a number of female-centered bills being introduced, he feels it's unfair to say men don't care about the issues.\n",
      "6917 \"Women have been engaged for a long time,\" the Carrollton Republican said.\n",
      "6918 \"When a situation has been brought to our attention, we've acted on it.\"\n",

      "6920 \"I don't often spend a lot of time during the day talking about menstrual pads,\" he said.\n",
      "6921 Another topic that male lawmakers have been uncomfortable talking about in the past is an effort to establish a room on the Capitol grounds for women who are nursing children or need to pump breast milk.\n",
      "6922 State Sen. Jen Jordan called her proposal, Senate Bill 4, a \"no-brainer\" -- especially with so many women serving in Legislature.\n",
      "6923 The Atlanta Democrat said that while she is working on several bills that focus on women, she didn't join the state Senate to advocate for women's issues.\n",
      "6924 But when she got to the chamber for her first legislative session last year, Jordan said she recognized the body had been a boys club for a long time.\n",
      "6925 \"I'm no stranger to misogyny,\" said Jordan, an attorney.\n",

      " Indiana is less taxing than Illinois  1,216 words 14 March 2019 Times of Northwest Indiana TNWI English Copyright 2019, nwitimes.com   U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes once described taxes as \"what we pay for civilized society.\"\n",
      "6941 While most people would consider Illinois and Indiana more or less equal in terms of civilization, Hoosiers unquestionably are paying far less in taxes for it.\n",
      "6942 Here are seven comparisons that highlight some of the significant tax differences between Illinois and Indiana.\n",
      "6943 Sales tax  Sales taxes generate nearly half the general fund revenue collected in Indiana that's used to pay for education, transportation, health care and nearly everything else state government does, provides or supports.\n",
      "6944 Indiana imposes a 7 percent sales tax on nearly all retail purchases no matter where in the state, or even online, the transaction occurs.\n",
      "6945 Only California has a higher statewide rate.\n",
      "6946 The state sales tax rate in Illinois is 6.25 percent.\n",
      "6947 But Illinois cities and counties are permitted to add a local sales tax on top of the state charge, often pushing the effective sales tax rate well above what Hoosiers pay.\n",
      "6948 For example, the combined sales tax rate in the city of Chicago is 10.25 percent, one of the highest in the nation.\n",
      "6949 Orland Park is 9.75 percent, Bolingbrook 8.5 percent, Naperville 7.5 percent and Schaumburg 10 percent.\n",
      "6950 Neither state generally assesses sales tax on services, such as hair cuts, auto repairs or lawyers.\n",
      "6951 But Indiana leaders reportedly are looking to expand the sales tax to services as a way to lower the rate without reducing state revenue.\n",
      "6952 Income tax  Approximately 65 percent of Illinois state revenue annually is generated by the state's 4.95 percent income tax on individuals, and 7 percent income tax on businesses.\n",
      "6953 Indiana is comparatively less dependent on the income tax and charges lower rates: 3.23 percent for individuals; and 5.75 percent on businesses.\n",
      "6954 Both Illinois and Indiana are among just eight states with a flat income tax, as such every resident and business pays the same rate no matter their earnings.\n",
      "6955 Most other states tax individuals with higher incomes at higher rates.\n",
      "6956 Unlike the sales tax, Illinois localities are not permitted to collect a local income tax.\n",
      "6957 However, Indiana counties must impose a local income tax on individuals, which sometimes pushes what Hoosiers pay above the Illinois rate.\n",
      "6958 Lake County residents, for example, pay a 1.5 percent county income tax on top of the 3.23 percent state rate, for a combined income tax rate of 4.73 percent —early matching Illinois.\n",
      "6959 The 2.864 percent local income tax in Jasper County, and the 2.02 percent rate Indianapolis residents pay in Marion County, means those Hoosiers pay a higher total income tax rate compared to Illinois when the Indiana state rate is added in.\n",
      "6960 Property tax  Property tax caps amended into the Indiana Constitution in 2010 ensure that Hoosiers bear one of the lowest property tax burdens of any state in the country.\n",
      "6961 Indiana caps property taxes at 1 percent of assessed value for owner-occupied homes, 2 percent of assessed value for rental properties and farmland, and 3 percent of assessed value for business and industrial properties.\n",
      "6962 So the owner of a $200,000 home in Indiana never will pay more than $2,000 a year in property taxes, and often pays less, unless voters approve a referendum for a temporary property tax increase or the property is subject to special charges.\n",
      "6963 Property taxes in Illinois are not similarly capped and often vary widely depending on how much local governments, including school districts, want to charge property owners.\n",
      "6964 Education in Illinois largely is funded by property tax dollars.\n",
      "6965 According to the Tax Foundation, the average effective property tax rate in Illinois is 2.32 percent for an owner-occupied home.\n",
      "6966 As a result, the owner of a $200,000 house would be charged $4,640 in property taxes in Illinois, and likely much more in Cook County.\n",
      "6967 Cigarette tax  There's a good reason why the Indiana side of the Illinois-Indiana border is lined with tobacco stores —ower taxes.\n",
      "6968 Indiana's cigarette tax is just $0.995 per pack.\n",
      "6969 Whereas, cigarette purchasers in Chicago are taxed by the state of Illinois ($1.98 per pack), Cook County ($3 per pack) and the city ($1.18 per pack).\n",
      "6970 The combined $6.16 per pack cigarette tax is the highest state-local cigarette tax in the country.\n",
      "6971 Cigarette purchasers in most Cook County communities outside Chicago pay the sixth-highest combined state-local tax at $4.98 per pack.\n",
      "6972 Hoosier lawmakers this year are considering hiking the state's cigarette tax rate by $2 per pack.\n",
      "6973 While unlikely to become law, cigarettes in Indiana still would cost at least $3 less than Chicago if the higher tax were enacted.\n",
      "6974 Alcohol taxes  With Hoosiers no longer forced to shop in Illinois on Sundays to buy alcohol for at-home consumption, they also no longer are required to pay the higher Illinois alcohol taxes.\n",
      "6975 Illinois alcohol purchasers pay an excise tax of 23 cents per gallon of beer, $1.39 per gallon of wine and $8.55 per gallon of liquor.\n",
      "6976 Chicago and Cook County tack on additional tax of 29 cents per gallon of beer in the city and 6 cents in the county, up to 89 cents city andup to 45 cents county per gallon of wine, and $2.68 city and $2.50 county per gallon of liquor.\n",
      "6977 Combined Illinois and local sales taxes of up to 10.25 percent also are added to each purchase.\n",
      "6978 In Indiana, alcohol purchasers pay an excise tax of only 12 cents per gallon of beer, 47 cents per gallon of wine and $2.68 per gallon of liquor.\n",
      "6979 Indiana charges sales tax of 7 percent on alcohol purchases.\n",
      "6980 Fuel taxes  Most Illinois and Northwest Indiana gas stations get their fuel from the same source, the BP Whiting refinery.\n",
      "6981 But filling up in Indiana almost always is cheaper due to Illinois' local taxes.\n",
      "6982 In both states you pay 18.4 cents per gallon federal gas tax.\n",
      "6983 Illinois adds a 19 cents-per-gallon state gas tax and charges 6.25 percent state sales tax.\n",
      "6984 Indiana's gas tax is higher at 29 cents per gallon, as is the state sales tax at 7 percent.\n",
      "6985 But then Cook County (6 cents) and Chicago (5 cents) each tack on a local gas tax, and Illinois cities and counties also charge local sales tax —anging from an additional 4 percent in Chicago to 3.25 percent in Lansing to 1.25 percent in Crete.\n",
      "6986 Tampon tax  While individuals usually find lower sales tax rates on items purchased in Indiana, consumers buying feminine hygiene products might find it in their financial best interest to shop in Illinois.\n",
      "6987 An Illinois law that took effect Jan. 1, 2017 exempts tampons, menstrual pads and menstrual cups from state and local sales taxes of up to 10.25 percent that previously were applied to those products.\n",
      "6988 Illinois is among 11 states that have eliminated sales tax on feminine hygiene items as part of a national fairness initiative that seeks to remove taxes from necessities used by only one gender.\n",
      "6989 Hoosier lawmakers repeatedly have rejected attempts to exempt menstrual products, along with diapers, from the state's 7 percent sales tax.\n",

      "6996 RACHEL MARTIN: Those of you who don't have to buy tampons may not know that in many states, you pay a sales tax on menstrual products.\n",
      "6997 Several states, though, have either eliminated that tax or are considering doing so.\n",
      "6998 Stacey Vanek Smith and Constanza Gallardo from Planet Money's The Indicator have been adding up the costs of the so-called tampon tax.\n",
      "6999 STACEY VANEK SMITH: Sales tax - most people in this country pay sales tax on most of the things they buy.\n",
      "7000 It's a big source of state revenue.\n",
      "7001 Some items like food or water that are seen as, like, necessary to survival are not subject to this tax.\n",
      "7002 CONSTANZA GALLARDO: Prescription and nonprescription drugs are also exempt - medicines like aspirin, DayQuil or Viagra - also medical equipment and supplies, which can be things like ChapStick or gauze.\n",
      "7003 VANEK SMITH: But tampons, pads, cups and all of the menstrual hygiene products do not fall into the medical supply category in many states.\n",
      "7004 And a lot of people argue that's not fair.\n",
      "7005 GALLARDO: Zoe Salzman is one of the lawyers that filed a lawsuit in New York to eliminate the sales tax on menstrual products back in 2016.\n",
      "7006 Salzman and her team argued these products are a medical supply, and they should be tax-exempt.\n",
      "7007 ZOE SALZMAN: And one example the department of tax gave was things like bandages, gauze and dressings.\n",
      "7008 And so those are items that are used to staunch the flow of blood from the human body.\n",
      "7009 And tampons and pads, as well as cups and panty liners - those are used to staunch the flow of blood from the uterus.\n",
      "7010 So again, clearly, you know, these items have to fit within that definition.\n",
      "7011 VANEK SMITH: Zoe made her case, and the New York Legislature took notice and, in fact, passed a bill back in 2016 to exempt feminine products in New York from sales tax.\n",
      "7012 So that extra cost here in New York - we do not pay it anymore.\n",
      "7013 GALLARDO: Yeah.\n",
      "7014 But many other women in other states do pay it.\n",
      "7015 And over time, that cost adds up.\n",
      "7016 And a study published this year by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists found that 2 out of 3 low-income women in the U.S. couldn't afford mental products at least once a year.\n",
      "7017 And nearly half of them struggled to buy both food and menstrual hygiene products over the last year.\n",
      "7018 In fact, there's economic research that the tax break on tampons really benefits low-income people.\n",
      "7019 That's based on consumer data after New Jersey's tampon tax was repealed back in 2005.\n",
      "7020 Research showed that by eliminating the tax, it made products cheaper and more accessible to lower-income women.\n",
      "7021 VANEK SMITH: But some people say the tampon tax needs to stay.\n",
      "7022 NICOLE KAEDING: When you start moving into this world of exemptions, you start adding complexity because you have to define what is and is not a qualified good under the exemption.\n",
      "7023 VANEK SMITH: Nicole Kaeding is with the Tax Foundation, a think tank that studies tax policy.\n",
      "7024 She says sales tax exemptions can be problematic because they can mean that states don't have enough money to fund public policies or programs, and as a result, states may have to increase other types of taxes to get that funding back.\n",
      "7025 GALLARDO: Back in 2016, California Governor Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that planned to eliminate the state's tampon tax.\n",
      "7026 He argued that by not taxing menstrual products, California could lose up to $20 million in annual taxes.\n",
      "7027 VANEK SMITH: And the governor has a point.\n",
      "7028 Here in New York, where we eliminated the tax on menstrual products, we're losing about $14 million a year in lost tax revenue.\n",
      "7029 Of course, this isn't just an economic issue.\n",
      "7030 It's a political issue, too.\n",
      "7031 Last year, for example, Nevada voted to make menstrual products tax-exempt.\n",
      "7032 GALLARDO: And this year, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and California are pushing for legislation to repeal the tampon tax.\n",

      "7041 There are now 127 female members of Congress -- 25 seats in the Senate and 102 seats in the House of Representatives, which means women now constitute nearly a quarter of both the House and the Senate.\n",
      "7042 Like Lussiez, many feel that the inflow of women as elected officials this year is long overdue because representation of many groups and perspectives is crucial to a functioning democracy  \"While this last election may inspire more diversity in government, the growing leadership roles and voices of women in government, business, education and nonprofits has been a long time in coming as a natural progression of both politics and economics,\" said Carlos Caldwell, who teaches government courses at Santa Fe High School.\n",
      "7043 Ambrose Ferber, a Santa Fe Prep teacher and coach of the school's speech and debate team, agreed.\n",
      "7044 But he said any new wave of feminist energy coming into play should go far beyond the political sphere, moving into STEM fields and careers.\n",
      "7045 The National Girls Collaborative Project reports that women, especially minorities, are less likely to pursue higher education in science, technology, engineering or math.\n",
      "7046 Women receive between 15 percent and 40 percent fewer bachelor's degrees in computer science, engineering, math and physical sciences, according to the group.\n",
      "7047 Caldwell and Ferber  both are inspired by the young women they teach.\n",
      "7048 Caldwell said that his female students are outspoken in class, whether on the topic of income inequality, the sacrifices women made during the suffrage movement, the so-called tampon tax or debates on affirmative action and the right to privacy.\n",
      "7049 Ferber said that since he's been a teacher, young women have always been vocal and engaged in his classes.\n",
      "7050 But some female students wonder,  despite the gains women continue to  make, whether they are taken as seriously  as their male counterparts.\n",

      "7052 \"I have had [Legislative] representatives walk out on me while I am giving a speech and talk over me, been told that I couldn't be respected because of my clothing and had the door shut without being given a chance.\n",
      "7053 It's infuriating.\"\n",
      "7054 However, with the results of the recent election, young girls have a chance to see more role models making a difference.\n",
      "7055 Mercedes Torres, a senior at Capital High School and a student advisory member for the local school board, is inspired by the number of women taking office.\n",
      "7056 \"It is allowing young women to see that they do or can have a say in the rules that are constantly being created around them,\" she said.\n",

      "7106 But that's the beauty of the gas tax: There's no escaping it, unless you use public transportation (nearly non-existent in Maine), drive an electric car (expensive) or bike everywhere (a chilly option).\n",
      "7107 And while Mainers are famously frugal - myself included - nobody is going to move away from Maine because gas costs an extra 2 cents per gallon.\n",

      "7175 Gavin Newsom and his wife, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, unveiled Tuesday what they call a \"parents' agenda,\" including proposals to end the sales tax on tampons and diapers and to use revenue from legal marijuana sales to expand child care programs.\n",

      "7182 He said the money will come from the reserves of the fund that pays for the existing program.\n",
      "7183 Newsom's proposal to cut the tampon and diaper tax marked a departure from his predecessor, fellow Democrat Jerry Brown, who vetoed similar legislation in 2016.\n",
      "7184 Democratic Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who has tried to pass the diaper tax exemption for five years, suggested having parents of young children in the governor's office made the difference.\n",
      "7185 Brown, 81, did not have children.\n",
      "7186 \"I cannot tell you the frustration we've been through in trying to explain this to people who have never bought diapers,\" Gonzalez said.\n",
      "7187 Democratic Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia said her proposal to eliminate the tax on menstrual products is about creating \"menstrual equity,\" meaning women won't be taxed for products biology may require them to buy.\n",
      "7188 The proposal is about \"having a tax code that's gender neutral (and) a tax code that represents our values,\" she said.\n",
      "7189 Newsom admitted it was uncomfortable for him to talk about women's menstrual products, but said it's important for men to understand the issue.\n",
      "7190 He also declared himself a \"proud feminist\" and said more must be done to change the culture of caregiving at home, which he said too often falls to women.\n",

      "7193 The additional money from legalized marijuana sales would offer more spots in state child care programs, though he couldn't say how many spots.\n",
      "7194 Working families with children under 6 would get a new $1,000 tax credit, double what Newsom had proposed earlier this year.\n",
      "7195 Newsom's proposal to expand paid family leave falls short of the six-months-per-child plan he hopes to eventually pass.\n",
      "7196 California parents are now entitled to six weeks of paid leave at a fraction of their normal pay, which would extend to eight weeks per parent under Newsom's plan.\n",

      "7200 \"It's time for real reforms that will actually bring down the cost of living in the Golden State,\" she said in a statement.\n",

      "7484 \"We're pushing the envelope a little bit, one tampon at a time,\" said Council Member Amy Fowler, who co-sponsored the proposal with Council Members Erin Mendenhall and Ana Valdemoros.\n",
      "7485 \"We shouldn't be charging women and people who menstruate for this very essential and necessary hygiene product,\" Fowler said.\n",
      "7486 \"And as per all discrimination, it disproportionately affects people from a lower socioeconomic status.\"\n",
      "7487 A study published earlier this year in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that two-thirds of low-income women in St. Louis, Missouri, were unable to afford needed menstrual hygiene supplies.\n",
      "7488 The study was cited by the Salt Lake City Council in a statement Tuesday.\n",
      "7489 As awareness grows of the barriers some women face in accessing menstrual products, several cities across the United States - from New York City to Brookline, Massachusetts, to Montebello, California - have introduced initiatives similar to Salt Lake's in recent years.\n",
      "7490 And a handful of states, including New York, have passed laws requiring schools or prisons to provide menstrual products at no cost.\n",
      "7491 \"As women in this digital world, it's not often we have a quarter in our pockets anymore,\" Mendenhall said, referencing the current 25-cent price of tampons in City Hall restrooms.\n",
      "7492 \"The idea that we could be caught ... unprepared for the need of such a product is not something that any woman or girl should have to face.\"\n",
      "7493 It's not known yet exactly how Salt Lake City's pilot program will be implemented, but the intention is for the $20,000 in funding to cover all city buildings, including City Hall and every city library branch, according to Mendenhall.\n",
      "7494 The council is also encouraging city enterprise funds - including airport, public utilities, and golf - to consider the initiative.\n",
      "7495 The city will track and analyze the program in its pilot year to determine whether and how it might be implemented again in the future.\n",
      "7496 The initial proposal asked for $10,000 in funding to put free hygiene products at City Hall and the main branch of the city library; Council Chair Charlie Luke then doubled the original budget suggestion.\n",
      "7497 Utah Women's Coalition policy director Akela Bellazetin praised the initiative as \"great news and a step forward\" for the city and state.\n",
      "7498 \"I think putting anything in place that makes Utah families' lives easier, whether that be childcare or something as seemingly meaningless as hygiene supplies, is going to pay back in full,\" Bellazetin said.\n",
      "7499 \"Hopefully they see the benefits and other (cities and counties) can jump on board.\"\n",
      "7500 That other cities, counties and institutions will jump on board is a goal of the initiative's sponsors.\n",
      "7501 The council members would especially like to see the program expanded to the Salt Lake City School District and the county jail, Mendenhall said.\n",
      "7502 Fowler said she also sees the city's effort as linked to a push at the state level to eliminate the sales tax on tampons and sanitary pads.\n",
      "7503 Rep. Susan Duckworth, D-Magna, has in multiple recent legislative sessions unsuccessfully introduced a bill that would exempt menstrual products and diapers from Utah's sales tax.\n",
      "7504 Rep. Stephanie Pitcher, D-Salt Lake City, said that while she doesn't foresee the Utah Legislature eliminating the so-called \"tampon tax\" anytime soon, she hopes the Salt Lake City initiative eases some of the \"discomfort\" she sees around similar discussions in the statehouse.\n",
      "7505 \"I think cities kind of spearheading this and taking the lead is really the right place for it to start,\" Pitcher said.\n",

      "7507 Some countries now offer paid menstrual leave for women suffering debilitating period pain  Monthly period pain is cramping the ability of many women to do their jobs.\n",
      "7508 Netherlands scientists asked almost 33,000 women ages 15 to 45 to discuss their menstrual cycles and how their symptoms impacted their work between July and October 2017.\n",
      "7509 The result: women lose almost nine days of workplace productivity on average from menstrual cramp discomfort, which is caused by uterine contractions.\n",
      "7510 And just over 3% of them said that the symptoms get so severe that they stay home from work during every or almost every period.\n",
      "7511 The analysis published in the British Medical Journal found that more than 26,000 women attempt to push through the pain each month, but they are often not working at 100% —nd so researchers recorded an average self-reported loss of workplace productivity of 33% on an average of 23.2 days over the year.\n",
      "7512 This presenteeism —r working while physically sick or mentally “hecked out”—dded up to an average of 8.9 days of lost productivity annually.\n",
      "7513 Related: etting your period earlier than peers could mean mental health issues —or years  Another 4,514 women said that they called out during these painful periods instead of coming into work, but only one in five of them told their boss that the sick day was due to period pain.\n",
      "7514 This is due to the stigma around discussing matters related to the menstrual cycle publicly, even though more than 800 million girls and women are menstruating on any given day.\n",
      "7515 For example, women who dropped a tampon in a 2002 study were seen as less competent and less likeable.\n",
      "7516 And most U.S. states still tax tampons and sanity pads —ven though they are a medical necessity for the female half of the population for about 40 years of their lives —hile erectile dysfunction aid Viagra is not.\n",
      "7517 Nine states, including New York, Florida, Illinois and Nevada —ave eliminated the tampon tax, but a woman’ monthly cycle is still a taboo topic in many places.\n",
      "7518 Related:For less than $7 a month, you could never run out of tampons again  “here is an urgent need for more focus on the impact of these symptoms, especially in women aged under 21 years, for discussions of treatment options with women of all ages and, ideally, more flexibility for women who work or go to school,”he Netherlands researchers concluded in the new study.\n",
      "7519 Indeed, two-thirds of the survey respondents said they wished they had greater flexibility to work remotely during their periods.\n",
      "7520 That could not only ease the pain, but make them even more productive: working from home was deemed the most productive workspace in a 2018 survey of global business professionals, who said they were able to accomplish more when they weren’ losing valuale time to commuting or being distracted by coworkers in the office.\n",
      "7521 About 40%-50% of women have primary dysmenorrhea —he medical term for painful periods.\n",
      "7522 And a 2012 study published in American Family Physician found that one in five women suffers period symptoms painful enough to disrupt her daily activities.\n",
      "7523 And 10% suffer endometriosis, a uterine tissue disorder that can cause pelvic pain and make period symptoms even worse.\n",
      "7524 In fact, some gynecologists have said that period cramps are often be more painful than heart attacks (which often produce mild pain than the excruciating chest pain most people associate with them), or have likened severe menstrual cramps to the pain of going into labor.\n",
      "7525 So some countries —ncluding Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, South Korea and China —ave begun offering paid menstrual leave in recent years, and private Indian companies Culture Machine and Gozoop, Australia’ Victorian Women’ Trust, and U.K. employer Coexist also have instituted paid period leave for female employees.\n",

      "7531 PROVIDENCE —fter taking nearly a week to decide, Governor Gina M. Raimondo on Friday reluctantly signed the $10 billion state budget, warning that it “nwisely takes our foot off the gas at a critical point in our comeback.\"\n",
      "7532 Raimondo, a Democrat starting her second term, has signed each of the five budgets she has been presented with since taking office, but this year's delay prompted speculation that she might issue her first budget veto or let it become law this weekend without her signature.\n",
      "7533 In a letter transmitting the fiscal year 2020 budget to the House of Representatives, Raimondo praised progress on her priorities, including pre-kindergarten programs and increased funding to support students learning English.\n",
      "7534 The budget adds 300 more pre-K seats to the 1,080 already funded, and doubles funding for English language learner programs to $5 million.\n",
      "7535 But she underscored sharp differences with legislative leaders.\n",
      "7536 “he General Assembly's budget restricts our ability to grow the economy and unwisely takes our foot off the gas at a critical point in our comeback,\" Raimondo said.\n",
      "7537 “y cutting our innovative and effective new economic development tools, our progress is put at risk.\"\n",
      "7538 The governor criticized “hortsighted changes\" to the Real Jobs Rhode Island job training program and the Qualified Jobs program, and she blasted a new “mall Business Development Fund\" that taps $42 million in state tax credits.\n",
      "7539 “nstead of bolstering these proven initiatives, the General Assembly's budget creates a new controversial tax incentive program benefiting wealthy out-of-state investors that could put $42 million of taxpayer money at risk and increase our structural deficit,\" she said.\n",
      "7540 “ am concerned it returns us to the old way of doing things.\"\n",
      "7541 House Speaker Nicholas A. Mattiello, a Cranston Democrat, and Senate President Dominick J. Ruggerio, a North Providence Democrat, issued a joint statement defending the budget and calling into question the governor's economic development and tax strategies.\n",
      "7542 “he budget is responsive to concerns that the economic development policies of the last four years have not done enough to help home-grown small businesses,\" the legislative leaders said.\n",
      "7543 They noted the budget fully funds Mattiello's priority of phasing out the car tax, saying that was “omething the Governor attempted to slow down.\"\n",
      "7544 And they said the budget “pares Rhode Island businesses the costly new taxes the Governor had sought to impose.\"\n",
      "7545 The budget funds the third year of a six-year car tax phaseout that will be completed in 2023.\n",
      "7546 The budgets adds a new “Netflix\" tax on digital downloads and streaming, but it eliminates a “tampon tax\" on feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "7547 Raimondo also took issue with a budget article that lets the state controller halt payments for state agencies on pace to overspend their budgets —ith exceptions made for “mmediate health and safety reasons.\"\n",
      "7548 The flash point is the beleaguered Department of Children, Youth and Families —he subject of a scathing report about the death of a special-needs child in January.\n",
      "7549 “his budget places unprecedented restrictions on the ability of the executive branch to account for unforeseen increases in the number of children and families we serve as part of our legal and moral obligation to care for vulnerable Rhode Islanders,\" Raimondo said.\n",
      "7550 House spokesman Larry Berman said DCYF requested $236.6 million but Raimondo only budgeted $228.6 million.\n",
      "7551 “he General Assembly gave the governor exactly what she asked for in the DCYF budget,\" he said.\n",
      "7552 The legislature needs to impose greater accountability on Raimondo's administration “o curb overspending and encourage fiscal discipline while being responsive to health and safety concerns,\" Mattiello and Ruggerio said.\n",
      "7553 “iven recent management failures, it's not surprising that these important measures would be met with such resistance from the Governor.\"\n",
      "7554 Raimondo bemoaned the lack of a line-item veto —n issue that gained renewed attention amid controversy over $1 million budgeted for a Cranston chiropractor's alternative brain therapy program.\n",
      "7555 Mattiello ended up removing the funding.\n",
      "7556 “e are one of only six states that lack a line-item veto — critical tool for ensuring transparency and accountability,\" the governor said.\n",
      "7557 “t has the support of a solid majority of Rhode Islanders, and I look forward to working with the General Assembly to put it on next year's ballot.\"\n",
      "7558 Berman said that if the governor had line-item veto power, she would have removed the provision aimed at curtailing administration overspending, which has been a significant concern for rank-and-file legislators.\n",
      "7559 Raimondo signed the budget two days after Moody's Investor Service placed Rhode Island on a list of seven states that were beginning the fiscal year on July 1 without a newly enacted budget in place —hich the credit-rating agency called “ sign of governance weakness.\"\n",
      "7560 Brown University political science Professor Wendy Schiller said vetoing the budget would not have been a good option for the governor.\n",
      "7561 “irst of all, she wants Rhode Island to look to the outside world like it's running well,\" Schiller said.\n",
      "7562 Also, the governor had to acknowledge that progressives just won a victory in passing an abortion rights law, which Mattiello and Ruggerio opposed but allowed to come to final votes, she said.\n",

      "7572 Why are tampons taxed when Viagra isn’?\n",
      "7573 That’ the question at the heart of the push to repeal the so-called tampon tax, a catchy phrase that refers to state sales taxes applied to menstrual products, including pads and cups.\n",
      "7574 Thirty-five states still tax the items, despite momentum to change that.\n",
      "7575 Opponents of the tax argue that tampons and pads should be treated like groceries and medical supplies: They should be tax-exempt because they are necessities.\n",
      "7576 If you buy a box of pads every month for 40 years, they argue, those charges add up, amounting to yet another example of a “ink tax,” term for the higher prices women pay for gender-specific products.\n",
      "7577 “he tampon tax amounts to sex-based discrimination,”aid Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a co-founder of the nonprofit Period Equity, which is leading a campaign to eliminate the tax.\n",
      "7578 But others argue that states need the revenue, and that creating exemptions for individual items is misguided.\n",
      "7579 For example, soap is generally taxed, though most people agree that it is a necessity.\n",
      "7580 Where should we draw the line?\n",
      "7581 “very time another exemption is passed, it means the tax rate that applies to everything else will have to increase in order to generate that same amount of revenue,”aid Katherine E. Loughead, a policy analyst at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington.\n",
      "7582 Despite those concerns, public opposition to the tax appears to be widespread.\n",
      "7583 The market research company OnePoll surveyed 2,000 women in the United States last month on behalf of Intimina, a menstrual cup manufacturer, and found that 67 percent of respondents thought a tax on period products was sexist.\n",
      "7584 Between 2016 and 2018, Nevada, New York, Florida, Connecticut and Illinois eliminated the tax, while many other states introduced bills to do so.\n",
      "7585 (Five states already had an exemption on the books, and five others do not have sales tax.)\n",
      "7586 Around the world, Canada, India, Malaysia and Australia have nixed the tax, and Britain is on track to do so once Brexit negotiations are settled.\n",
      "7587 This year, lawmakers in 22 states introduced bills to repeal the tax, but none were signed into law.\n",
      "7588 California and Rhode Island did repeal the tax in their budgets, while Virginia decreased it, and several states took steps to increase access to menstrual products in schools, prisons and shelters.\n",
      "7589 But the dearth of action on the tax in most states frustrated proponents of “menstrual equity,” concept that refers to equal access to information and period products.\n",
      "7590 They say they are now exploring legal strategies to challenge the tax, and have invited experts to discuss the tactics at a conference this fall at Columbia Law School.\n",
      "7591 The director of the school’ Center for Gender and Sexuality Law, Katherine Franke, said she believes the courts will agree that the tax is an unfair penalty on women.\n",
      "7592 (Of course, trans and nonbinary people may also menstruate.)\n",
      "7593 “hat this case really does is highlight a day-to-day way in which women experience discrimination in one of their most basic bodily functions,”he said.\n",
      "7594 Here’ what happened in some key states  Rhode Island repealed the tax in its budget bill.\n",
      "7595 Representative Edith H. Ajello and Senator Louis P. DiPalma, both Democrats, had submitted separate legislation to do so earlier in the year, as they had every year since 2016.\n",
      "7596 The measure, which would cost around $800,000 a year, was effectively approved through the budget, Ms. Ajello said.\n",
      "7597 “ never heard anybody say it was a bad idea to get rid of the tax,”s.\n",
      "7598 Ajello said.\n",
      "7599 “ just heard some people wonder whether we could afford it.”  In California, Gov.\n",
      "7600 Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, held a news conference in May surrounded by giant boxes of diapers and tampons, and announced a plan to eliminate the tax on both in the state budget.\n",
      "7601 It was a stark contrast to the approach of his predecessor, Jerry Brown, also a Democrat, who had vetoed a bill to eliminate taxes on those items, arguing that “ax breaks are the same as new spending.”  But Mr. Newsom’ exemption will last only two years, in contrast to a law, which would be in place permanently.\n",
      "7602 “e hope to extend it, but we hope to be in a fiscal position to do so and we want to maintain our prudence,”r.\n",
      "7603 Newsom said, according to The Los Angeles Times.\n",
      "7604 The L.A. Times noted that the cost of eliminating the taxes on both period products and diapers was estimated at $76 million per year.\n",
      "7605 In Maine, the House and Senate passed a bill sponsored by Representative Denise Tepler, a Democrat, to repeal the tax.\n",
      "7606 But lawmakers did not designate money to cover its cost, which was estimated at $817,000 in the next full fiscal year, so it did not advance.\n",
      "7607 It could still be funded next year, at which point it would move to the governor’ desk, Ms. Tepler said.\n",
      "7608 Ms. Tepler said that she agreed that aspects of the tax code didn’ make sense —or example, she asked, why are diapers taxed when fancy cuts of meat aren’?\n",
      "7609 She called for a deeper rethinking of sales tax policy.\n",
      "7610 In Georgia, lawmakers shelved a proposal to nix the 4 percent tax, but allocated funds to provide free menstrual products in schools and community centers in low-income areas.\n",
      "7611 In Virginia, lawmakers reduced the tax on menstrual products and diapers to 2.5 percent, rather than nixing it entirely.\n",
      "7612 It had been as high as 7 percent in some parts of the state.\n",
      "7613 Michigan was one of many states where anti-tampon tax proposals failed to gain traction.Senator Winnie Brinks, a Democrat who co-sponsored two such bills, said she was moved to act after years of paying for menstrual products for herself and her three daughters.\n",
      "7614 She said that she couldn’ think of any other tax that was levied on only one sex.\n",
      "7615 In Louisiana, Senator J.P. Morrell, a Democrat, sponsored a bill to eliminate taxes on diapers and menstrual products.\n",
      "7616 In negotiations, lawmakers sought to combine the measure with tax breaks on firearms and other items, he said.\n",
      "7617 Opponents voiced concern about the cost, and prevailed.\n",
      "7618 The other states where bills were introduced but did not advance were Arizona, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and West Virginia, according to a database compiled by Period Equity.\n",
      "7619 Advocates say they’e “utting states on notice”  Ms. Weiss-Wolf and her colleagues say they’e seeking to mobilize legal action around the idea that a tax on menstrual products amounts to an unconstitutional tax on women.\n",

      "7637 Instead of saying that, the Administration said they wanted to protect minority voters.\n",
      "7638 The Supreme Court denied the census addition, which I did not expect because the reason for their refusal, on the basis of inauthenticity, seems less precedented than a more substantial reason like constitutionality.\n",
      "7639 I was not shocked, however, by how, after the President’ tweet, a complete reversal of his administration’ decision to give up, the federal government was forced to pick up the pieces, and chaos ensued as the lawyers defending the census question almost left the case.\n",
      "7640 What intrigues me is Liptak’ suggestion that Trump’ fear-mongering, as well as continued fighting, are so pervasive throughout his base, and undocumented immigrant communities, that it doesn’ matter, ultimately, whether the question ends up on the census —e will get the results he wants, of fear in undocumented people and a winner’ high for his followers.\n",

      "8114 After President Donald Trump was elected in 2016, Jennifer Weiss-Wolf was working on a book about periods and constantly worrying that her exploration of menstruation would flop in the face of everything else happening politically.\n",
      "8115 Then, the #MeToo movement broke open in 2017, a week after her book’ release, and the fear of irrelevance came flooding back.\n",
      "8116 “ut I took a total about-face,”he said, “nd I thought, ‘ctually, this is the exact same thing.’“  Weiss-Wolf, the vice president of development at the Brennan Center for Justice, is one of the pioneers of the movement to achieve menstrual equity —he idea that too few policies, from taxes to public benefits to labor law, account for the half of the population that menstruates each month.\n",
      "8117 The efforts have led dozens of states to consider measures eliminating taxes on menstrual products and improving access to such products in public facilities.\n",
      "8118 Now comes the nation’ first Period Day, a collection of rallies Oct. 19 aimed to bring awareness to periods as the movement aligns itself with both #MeToo and the broader, largely youthdriven, post-Trump activism energy and push to equate menstrual equity with gender equity.\n",
      "8119 Eliminating the sales tax on period products, including pads and cups, a levy that exists in 35 states, has been the signature push for the movement.\n",
      "8120 So far, though, while legislators in 22 states introduced bills to ditch the tampon tax since summer 2018, none adopted such legislation (though two, California and Rhode Island, got rid of the tax by stripping it from the state budget).\n",
      "8121 In Pennsylvania and New Jersey, menstrual products haven’ been taxed for years, so the focus is now to think beyond the “tampon tax.”  Among the biggest goals for young activists: how to get people to talk about periods the way they would, say, the common cold.\n",
      "8122 The National Period Day planned here for LOVE Park was put together by the Abington Heights High School branch of Period., a national organization founded in 2014 that has hundreds of chapters.\n",

      "8125 “ thought that was completely unacceptable.”  In tackling that stigma, it helps that periods have become a part of the zeitgeist, maybe even more so than when then-candidate Trump said in 2015 that a debate moderator might have had “lood coming out of her wherever,”ausing #PeriodsAreNotAnInsult to trend on Twitter.\n",
      "8126 These days, parents are increasingly throwing their daughters “enstruation celebrations,”nd Apple announced this year that its new Apple Watch will have a built-in menstrual cycle tracker.\n",

      "8130 It’ a cause progressives can get behind in this fraught political landscape.\n",
      "8131 Providing tampons to neighbors or asking a local library chapter to stock pads in the bathroom feels, to some, like a way to easily solve an issue of access.\n",
      "8132 Lynette Medley said years ago when she started delivering donated menstrual products to people in her Northwest Philadelphia community, it was so hushhush that she felt like “ drug dealer in the middle of the night.”ut she said the #MeToo movement changed how women felt talking about their bodies.\n",
      "8133 “heir eagerness to talk about it enabled me to be more comfortable putting it out there,”aid Medley, CEO of No More Secrets in Mount Airy.\n",
      "8134 Addressing stigma leads to a bit of a chicken-and-egg question for the movement: Do you work to end the taboo to influence public policy?\n",

      "8186 There’ a “risis that’ being ignored because we don’ see it,”ccording to the video, noting that the taboos and taxes surrounding periods have a particularly adverse impact on low-income women, who are often forced to use rags, tissues and even paper towels taken from public bathrooms while menstruating.\n",
      "8187 “ociety might be getting ever-so-slightly more comfortable acknowledging that periods exist, but until we’e OK with women free-bleeding in the streets, we better work harder to make pads and tampons accessible to all,”aid Kate Catalinac, creative director at BBDO San Francisco.\n",

      "8251 Public awareness about period poverty, the inability to access menstrual hygiene products, has ignited a movement calling for free and accessible pads and tampons in restrooms and public spaces around the world.\n",
      "8252 Period poverty impacts millions of people every day and is pervasive in US schools.\n",
      "8253 Across the country, thousands of students lack the resources to manage basic menstrual hygiene and are denied equal learning opportunities, as they often skip school or classes while having their period as a result.\n",
      "8254 According to a recent study, a startling one-in-five teens have struggled to afford period products or have not been able to purchase them at all, and one-in-four teens have missed class due the lack of access to menstrual hygiene products.\n",
      "8255 People with periods are taught from a young age that one of our body's natural processes is something to be ashamed of, and something we should go to great lengths to conceal.\n",
      "8256 We're taught to hide our period products in our sleeves on the way to the restroom, and constantly check our clothes for any leaks or stains.\n",
      "8257 The reality of period poverty, combined with the social stigma attached to having a period, like whispering for a tampon in the middle of class or the perception that periods are strictly prohibited as a topic of conversation, has long-lasting implications on a student's life.\n",
      "8258 Rather than face the stress and shame associated with these conversations, many students just choose to skip school altogether.\n",
      "8259 In fact, students reported that stress and shame were the most common emotions that they associated with menstruation.\n",
      "8260 The good news is that the menstrual equity movement has been gaining momentum, with policy proposals and pilot programs getting adopted in high schools and on university campuses, as well as legislation calling for the elimination of the 'tampon tax' or 'pink tax' at the state and municipal levels.\n",
      "8261 For example, Ohio recently passed a proposal repealing the state's sales tax on menstrual products in the House with unanimous support.\n",
      "8262 Connecticut eliminated the \"tampon tax\" in 2016 as part of the S 502 bill, which went into effect in July of 2018.\n",
      "8263 New York City now provides menstrual hygiene products free of charge in public schools, prisons and homeless shelters, acknowledging that menstrual hygiene products should be treated and supplied just like toilet paper, soap and water.\n",
      "8264 This removes all financial burdens for students who struggle to afford period products, and stigma by placing these products in a place where students can access them without having to draw attention to the need for them in the first place.\n",
      "8265 While we are beginning to see change, there is still a lot to be done to achieve universal access to these products for every young person who needs them.\n",
      "8266 First, we need to repeal the so-called \"tampon tax\" that essentially puts a luxury tax on anyone who menstruates in 34 states.\n",
      "8267 It's no secret that the tampon tax places an unfair financial burden on people with periods who already earn less than their cisgender male counterparts.\n",
      "8268 Removing these barriers to make period products more affordable is a crucial first step toward leveling the playing field.\n",
      "8269 Proper hygiene is a right, not a luxury.\n",
      "8270 Second, Congress must pass federal legislation like the proposed Menstrual Equity for All Act sponsored by Rep. Grace Meng that would enable states to use federal grants to provide students nationwide with period products in schools, require Medicaid to cover the cost of period products and let individuals use their own pre-tax dollars from flexible spending accounts to purchase menstrual products.\n",
      "8271 The legislation currently has 63 Democratic cosponsors.\n",
      "8272 Third, lawmakers need to prioritize medically accurate sex education at the state level.\n",
      "8273 Period education should be accessible and available for all students, and is possible under the Real Education for Healthy Youth Act.\n",
      "8274 Period poverty is an unacceptable national epidemic.\n",
      "8275 Let's start by acknowledging that far too many students in our schools are unable to afford basic health products like tampons and pads.\n",
      "8276 Only by acknowledging this tragic reality can we begin to take the steps that we need to dismantle this problem and ensure that everyone has access to the period products they need to live and thrive.\n",

      "8284 Byproducts of this stigma and under-representation include laws, norms, and practices that inherently financially penalize menstruation and decrease accessibility to hygiene products like tampons and sanitary pads.\n",
      "8285 Throughout their lifetime, individuals who menstruate have their periods for an average of 2,535 days, or seven years of requiring access to tampons or sanitary napkins to achieve safe and healthy menstrual hygiene.\n",
      "8286 The average menstruating person uses almost 17,000 hygiene products throughout their life, while one study found that two out of three people living below the poverty line have experienced being without hygiene products due to expenses.\n",
      "8287 Lacking access to menstrual care has serious implications, from poor health outcomes and lost work and educational instruction hours, to demoralization and embarrassment for those unable to afford essential hygiene products.\n",
      "8288 No one should have to miss work or school, risk their health or compromise their dignity because they menstruate.\n",
      "8289 It is well past time for the conversation of hygiene product accessibility and equality to be brought to the forefront.\n",
      "8290 The unfortunate reality is that, right here in Wisconsin, many people continue to lack access to and have the ability to afford menstrual products.\n",
      "8291 In our state, people who menstruate face an unjust tax burden on menstrual products, which are seen as a \"luxury item,\" and more often than not do not have access to menstrual products in public restrooms including schools and government-owned buildings.\n",
      "8292 According to Wisconsin tax code, food, electricity and prescription medications are not subject to sales tax, as they are deemed necessities.\n",
      "8293 At the same time, items such as potato chips, Kit Kats, Viagra and gym memberships are also not subject to state sales tax, yet hygiene products continue to face unjust taxation.\n",
      "8294 There are no other examples that represent such a clear gender-based tax.\n",
      "8295 Hygiene products are not optional; they are necessities.\n",
      "8296 The ability to manage this bodily function is essential, not an entitlement or privilege, and is oftentimes an urgent, unexpected need.\n",
      "8297 Menstrual products are not a luxury good, nor a government handout when those who do not menstruate walk into a public restroom, they have everything they need to take care of bodily functions, while those who do menstruate do not.\n",
      "8298 Data from programs around the nation show that the cost of providing these products is significantly less than the cost of soap, toilet paper, paper towel and other bathroom supplies currently being provided in bathrooms everywhere.\n",
      "8299 No individual should have to be without menstrual products when they are in need.\n",
      "8300 I am proud to continue to sponsor legislation that takes crucial steps in helping to bring menstrual equality to Wisconsin by providing menstrual products in state, local and school buildings, and ending the unjust \"tampon tax.\"\n",

      "8310 But when an issue like the “tampon tax”—he effort to exempt menstrual products from sales tax in hopes of more gender-equitable tax policy —akes it into Utah’ tax reform bill with unanimous approval, it is something to celebrate.\n",
      "8311 Here’ why.\n",
      "8312 Despite the fact that menstrual products are used by 50 percent of the population for the greater part of their life, these things have notoriously been overlooked as items that should be “xempt”rom any type of tax.\n",
      "8313 Meanwhile Rogaine and Viagra —sed by far less than 50 percent of the population and thought of as a “eed”menstrual products are more of a “uxury” —njoy not only the sales-tax exemption, but also federal tax exemption if purchased using HSAs, Medicaid and FSAs.\n",
      "8314 And changing tax code, even at the state level, is no small thing.\n",
      "8315 Just ask state Rep. Susan Duckworth, who has introduced the tampon tax bill for the last four years —nly to see it die in committee.\n",
      "8316 And for a reason.\n",
      "8317 Utah is a fiscally conservative state that wisely hesitates on ‘xtra’pending.\n",
      "8318 So, despite the inclusiveness of the issue (menstruation knows no political party), this has been pushed aside —o the detriment of half of the population.\n",
      "8319 Which is why, on a Tuesday evening at 4:30, a hint of warm weather before the cold, I found myself content sitting in a windowless room 30 in the basement of the House Building, during the meeting of the Tax Restructuring and Equalization Task Force, to see this exemption voted in.\n",
      "8320 There are plenty of arguments as to why menstrual policy is needed.\n",
      "8321 Twenty percent of girls miss school at least once a month because of a lack of access to menstrual products.\n",
      "8322 Not because of pain.\n",
      "8323 Not because of moodiness.\n",
      "8324 Because they don’ have a tampon or a pad.\n",
      "8325 Sheila, an educator in Utah county, spoke at the recent Stand for Women’ Health for National Period Day event and described her youth as one in which all of the girls in her community spent a week a month home from school so they could sit on rags because they could not afford menstrual products.\n",
      "8326 A 10th grader in Salt Lake said her family can’ afford menstrual products so they buy cotton balls and fold rags over them.\n",
      "8327 She explained that she and her two sisters typically don’ go to school during their periods, for fear of the cotton balls falling out of their pants or not being absorbent.\n",
      "8328 And missed school can lead to a costly increased dropout rate — person who does not complete high school costs the state about $292,000.\n",
      "8329 There are other statistics —ike 25 percent of women are not able to afford period products —hich affects their ability to consistently attend work.\n",
      "8330 And about half of those women must make the choice between a period product, or a meal—oth for themselves and for their children.\n",
      "8331 But the biggest obstacle in the progression of menstrual policy is the stigma.\n",
      "8332 We scientifically know menstruation is natural and necessary —rguably more so than hair loss or erectile dysfunction.\n",
      "8333 Yet because periods can be an “mbarrassing”“emale”“athroom problem,”t’ tough to move menstruation into daily conversation, let alone legislation.\n",
      "8334 One national organization, Period, compared menstruation to bloody noses in a powerful video, stating, “f faces were bleeding, someone would do something about it.”  And they’e right.\n",
      "8335 If 50 percent of the population had a bloody nose that lasted three to five days every month—nd a quarter of them couldn’ afford product to stop it—e’ legislate.\n",
      "8336 And so it is with great relief that Utah has taken the first step.\n",
      "8337 So, thank you.\n",
      "8338 Thank you, members of the Tax Restructuring and Equalization Task Force.\n",
      "8339 There is still a long way to go.\n",
      "8340 A first round bill is far from law.\n",
      "8341 And there will be naysayers—here always are.\n",

      "8455 All other items are non-essential and therefore subject to the higher tax rate.\n",

      "8476 A significant tax cut for Utahns is the key sweetening ingredient in a sweeping tax plan that state lawmakers have been assembling in recent months.\n",
      "8477 And while the most recent public version of the proposal does lessen the overall tax burden by about $80 million, nearly a third of individual tax filers would actually pay more, according to a legislative staff analysis.\n",
      "8478 Leaders of the reform push have been negotiating changes to the draft plan over the past couple weeks, and Rep. Robert Spendlove, a Sandy Republican and economist, says the tax analysis applies what he calls a “aseline scenario”hat lawmakers will continue to refine.\n",
      "8479 “ think all of our goal is to have the overall package be a net tax cut for everyone,”pendlove, who’ participating in these tax discussions, said in a phone interview.\n",
      "8480 “nd that’ what we’e really trying to achieve with this analysis is saying, ‘hat will it take to get in that net tax reduction for everyone?’”  Thirty-one percent of tax filers would see an increase under this “aseline scenario,”hich reflected a draft bill released earlier this month by a legislative task force.\n",
      "8481 Many of those filers appear to be on the lower end of the income spectrum, according to a scatter plot of the reform plan’ impact.\n",
      "8482 Those who would be at greatest risk of a tax hike are people who can’ claim a personal exemption —uch as young adults still listed by their parents as dependents.\n",
      "8483 Many filers with two exemptions, a category that includes couples without children or a single parent with one child, would also pay more, a legislative staff analysis shows.\n",
      "8484 Detailed Tax Incidence Scatterplots by The Salt Lake Tribune on Scribd  Description: This analysis from the Utah Office of the Legislative Fiscal Analyst shows the impact of a proposed tax plan discussed by state lawmakers.\n",
      "8485 Each dot represents a single tax filer; those above the green line would experience a tax increase.\n",
      "8486 Nearly all parents with multiple children would experience a tax decrease, thanks largely to a proposal to quadruple the dependent exemption.\n",
      "8487 When asked to comment on the breakdown of tax cuts vs. hikes, a House of Representatives spokesman said the proposal has evolved since that modeling took place.\n",
      "8488 He said he was unable to provide an updated analysis and noted that the task force is expecting to unveil a new proposed bill Friday.\n",
      "8489 House Speaker Brad Wilson, R-Kaysville, offered few details Wednesday about the forthcoming draft but said lawmakers are “aking great progress”oward crafting something they can bring to a special session next month.\n",
      "8490 The new version will tweak a list of newly-taxed service transactions, but Wilson said there are “ot a lot of changes”rom the draft the public has already seen.\n",
      "8491 Alliance for a Better Utah, a left-leaning good government group, believes lawmakers should balance tax cuts against the need for funding to support education and other vital government services.\n",
      "8492 But if officials are dead set on tax reductions, they should target that relief to those struggling financially, argued Chase Thomas, the group’ executive director.\n",
      "8493 \"We should be having tax proposals that help low-income individuals and families rather than giving these big tax decreases to those who already have money or who have large families,\" Thomas said.\n",
      "8494 The Utah director for Americans for Prosperity said bloated government spending and overtaxation creates barriers for state’ residents and faulted the proposal released earlier this month for failing to give everyone a boost.\n",
      "8495 “he goal should be to eliminate as many tax credits and exemptions as possible, while simultaneously lowering rates so that everyone benefits,”eather Andrews of AFP-Utah said in a prepared statement.\n",
      "8496 “his bill decreases some tax rates, but continues down the dangerous path of picking winners and losers with the way it arbitrarily selects sales tax exemptions and expansions.”  The current push to reform taxes started earlier this year with the formation of a legislative task force, which spent the summer on a statewide tour to hear from Utahns and convince them the government’ financial future is on shaky ground —argely because the sales tax base is eroding, they say.\n",
      "8497 The panel’ two chairmen earlier this month rolled out a 182-page draft bill that sought to reinforce the state’ sales tax structure by increasing the sales tax on groceries, adding sales taxes to gasoline and certain services and repealing a list of tax exemptions.\n",
      "8498 To counteract those revenue increases, the current plan calls for a significant income tax rate decrease along with new credits and expanded exemptions.\n",
      "8499 Overall, the proposal would yield a cut of about $132 million for individual Utahns.\n",
      "8500 While Wilson sounded confident Wednesday about progress on the plan, other members of the legislative task force are voicing concerns about the proposal and the process involved in its creation.\n",
      "8501 Sen. Curt Bramble, a Provo accountant who sits on the task force, said he has “erious reservations”bout the draft bill.\n",
      "8502 In addition, pushing for a special session on taxes leaves lawmakers without a chance to present the proposal to their constituents and build buy-in, he said.\n",
      "8503 “he timing on this is very difficult because we don’ have time to make the case,\" Bramble, a Republican, said.\n",
      "8504 The increased food tax — $250 million portion of the plan —as run into opposition from Democratic legislators and anti-poverty groups who say it would fall heaviest on low-earning families.\n",
      "8505 Some of these advocates rallied at the Utah Capitol on Wednesday, calling on lawmakers not only to reject a food tax hike but to scrap the existing 1.75% state sales tax on groceries.\n",
      "8506 The plan does contain relief designed to blunt the impact that an increased food tax would have on low-to-middle earners, with grocery store credits and an earned income tax credit addressing intergenerational poverty.\n",
      "8507 But advocates and religious leaders Wednesday argued these offsets will not adequately compensate for the food tax hike.\n",
      "8508 “e want our legislators to understand a once-a-year rebate will not repair the harm done to families by this tax increase that will impact their budget every single week,”he Rev.\n",
      "8509 Vinnetta Golphin-Wilkerson of Granger Community Christian Church in West Valley City said during the rally.\n",
      "8510 Rep. Joel Briscoe, a Salt Lake City Democrat and member of the legislative task force, said he’ recently met with House leadership to talk about the tax proposal —nd conveyed his caucus’pposition to lifting the sales tax on groceries.\n",
      "8511 “’ not hearing any Democrats say that they can vote for the sales tax back on food,”e said Wednesday.\n",
      "8512 During their discussion of the tax proposal, members of the House Democratic Caucus suggested that a provision in the bill repealing the sales tax on feminine hygiene products was intended as a lure for bipartisan support.\n"

      "8519 Caroline Kitchener  1,153 words 9 December 2019 The Washington Post WP FINAL B02 English Copyright 2019, The Washington Post Co. All Rights Reserved   It's not easy to find a free tampon at the University of Maryland at College Park.\n",
      "8520 Women generally don't know they can head to the student union building, where sanitary dispensers are stocked and coinless.\n",
      "8521 (When students hung posters advertising where to find the free products, they were told to take them down.\n",
      "8522 Too many people would squirrel away products for home use, the university said.)\n",
      "8523 Another option is the library, where there's a sign on the door to the women's bathroom: If you need 'feminine hygiene products,' it says, please see the receptionist.\n",
      "8524 'You have to ask the person at the desk, who might be a 50-year-old man,' said senior Lauren Anikis, a journalism major with a pin that reads 'Kiss me I'm a senior' attached to her backpack.\n",
      "8525 'Even then, they're only going to give you one tampon.'\n",
      "8526 Since September, Anikis and four other Maryland students \" freshmen Zoe Weisberg and Hope Kahn, sophomore Hailey Chaikin and senior Claire Mudd \" have been trying to change how their university thinks about menstrual products.\n",
      "8527 It started as a class project: In a social entrepreneurship class, students were dispatched to 'do something good.'\n",
      "8528 One group tackled overuse of plastic water bottles; another, the refugee crisis.\n",
      "8529 Anikis's group decided to aim for free pads and tampons in every campus bathroom.\n",
      "8530 It seemed like a perfectly realistic goal.\n",
      "8531 Largely inspired by debate over the worldwide 'tampon tax' \" which puts a premium on menstrual products, classifying them as 'luxury goods' \" some colleges and universities have experimented with widely distributing free pads and tampons.\n",
      "8532 In 2016, Brown University became one of the first schools to implement a large-scale program to put free tampons in bathrooms.\n",
      "8533 Since then, a few larger public schools \" Ohio University, Texas A-M at Corpus Christi, the University of Illinois \" have started doing the same thing.\n",
      "8534 For Anikis and her classmates, who call themselves 'Genzennials,' the first step was to understand the nature of the problem.\n",
      "8535 Unlimited paper towels and toilet paper are available in every campus bathroom.\n",
      "8536 Full boxes of condoms are handed out in every dorm.\n",
      "8537 The group wanted to know: What's different about pads and tampons?\n",
      "8538 When the group's members put that question to a U-Md.\n",
      "8539 health center administrator, they were told condoms are a 'public health necessity,' Anikis said.\n",
      "8540 'Menstrual products are a health necessity, too,' Anikis said.\n",
      "8541 'But they're not thought of that way.'\n",
      "8542 Many low-income students have a hard time affording pads and tampons, said Chaikin \" especially the jacked-up prices at campus convenience stores, where an 18-pack of Tampax tampons costs $7.39.\n",
      "8543 (At CVS, the same box costs $5.99.)\n",
      "8544 Even if students have no problem paying for products, Kahn said, it's still important to make them widely available throughout campus.\n",
      "8545 'One girl we interviewed told us she got a yeast infection because she left her tampon in longer than she should have \" because she was on campus and couldn't get the supplies she needed,' she said.\n",
      "8546 The team decided to pitch a 'phase one' version of its project, asking the university for $18,000 to stock 15 of its most highly trafficked bathrooms for one year.\n",
      "8547 That request came from a series of trials: The students tracked frequency of bathroom use and frequency of menstrual product use when they strategically placed baskets of pads and tampons on the bathroom sink.\n",
      "8548 (In the most popular spot, it was precisely 1.6 menstrual products, per bathroom, per hour.)\n",
      "8549 Asked if the team had a spreadsheet to show its results, Chaikin laughed.\n",
      "8550 'Oh,' she said, whipping open her laptop, 'we sure do.'\n",
      "8551 The proposal included an abstract, a detailed budget, letters of support from various campus organizations \" the student government, the Period Club (yes, there is a period club) \" and photos of the coinless dispensers the students plan to use for distribution.\n",
      "8552 When the school told them that the proposal could be only three pages long, they included 14-additional pages of 'appendices.'\n",
      "8553 The group is now waiting on a final decision from the Student Facilities Fund and the maintenance department.\n",
      "8554 The team members met last month with the executive director of building and landscape maintenance \" known to them as 'the guy who can actually make this happen.'\n",
      "8555 They arrived at the conference room in business-casual outfits, toting several printed-out copies of their proposal.\n",
      "8556 The facilities manager loved what they had to say, Weisberg said.\n",
      "8557 He said he couldn't believe he hadn't thought of it sooner, she remembered.\n",
      "8558 (In a statement, the university's facilities department confirmed that it is looking into the students' plan, 'to determine a true cost associated with providing free menstrual products in 15 highly-trafficked bathrooms.')\n",
      "8559 By now, Anikis is used to this kind of reaction: Most people agree that menstrual products should be as readily accessible as toilet paper, she said, but seem to have never seriously contemplated the idea.\n",
      "8560 'I see this again and again when we tell people what we're doing,' Anikis said.\n",
      "8561 'They're like, 'Oh my god, yeah, that's so important, oh my god.'\n",
      "8562 It's this lightbulb moment of, 'Wow, that is unfair and dumb.'\n",
      "8563 '  The problem, Anikis said, is that people don't like to think about periods.\n",
      "8564 'People don't want to think about girls bleeding.\n",

      "8586 We have made outstanding progress, but we must continue the fight.\n",
      "8587 National Period Day was a single action of many to come - because more than 84% of menstruating students have missed school in the United States due to an inability to maintain their periods, because 30% of the menstruating population has trouble affording period products, because Viagra is taxed as a necessity and tampons are taxed as a luxury, because the English language has over 40 euphemisms for the word \"menstruation.\"\n",

      "8607 “t’ very humbling to think of women, girls, every person who menstruates, they’e going to have that savings.\n",
      "8608 And that is a beautiful thing,\" said Emily Bell McCormick, founder of The Policy Project, a health policy group in Salt Lake City.\n",
      "8609 McCormick helped lead local efforts to end the “tampon tax,”ncluding holding a rally in October at the Utah Capitol.\n",
      "8610 Organizers of the event spoke about how other items, including Rogaine and Viagra, were considered medically necessary, while tampons and pads were not.\n",
      "8611 The tax savings are “omething that men have experienced for a long time with their health needs, and it’ time for women to enjoy that same benefit,”cCormick said.\n",

      "8614 Gary Herbert announced Thursday that he signed the new tax bill, and it will go into effect early next year.\n",
      "8615 In addition to addressing period products, the reform package passed Dec. 12 during a special session cuts Utah’ income tax and increases the state grocery tax, among other changes.\n",
      "8616 The bill creates a sales and use tax exemption for menstrual products, including tampons, panty liners, menstrual cups, sanitary napkins or “ther similar tangible personal property designed for hygiene in connection with the human menstrual cycle.”t adds that menstrual products do not include soaps or cleaning solutions, shampoo, toothpaste, mouthwash, antiperspirants or suntan lotions or sunscreens.\n",
      "8617 Rep. Susan Duckworth, D-Magna, had tried for years to exclude disposable hygiene products from the state’ sales tax, without success.\n",
      "8618 McCormick thinks what made the proposal pass this year was “iming and national momentum.”  Utah is the 18th state to eliminate the tampon tax, she said.\n",
      "8619 And there’ a national movement, called Tax Free.\n",
      "8620 Period., from the nonprofit Period Equality and LOLA, an organic period product company, that’ considering legal action against states that haven’ eliminated the tampon tax, based on discrimination law.\n",
      "8621 But in Utah, specifically, “ think what happened that was different this year is that we were able to organize and get people out there to reframe the issue for our Legislature,”cCormick said.\n",
      "8622 In the past, this was “een as a pretty extreme movement,”nd it seemed uncomfortable to talk about menstruation in a public space.\n",
      "8623 But “e reframed this as, 'Oh, no, this is totally normal.\n",
      "8624 It’ completely appropriate to talk about.\n",
      "8625 It needs to be talked about,\" she said.\n",
      "8626 While eliminating the tampon tax was seen more as an issue supported by Democrats in the past, McCormick said advocates were able to find bipartisan support this time.\n",
      "8627 “hat was 100 percent key to the success of this.\n",
      "8628 This has to be seen as nonpartisan,”he said.\n",
      "8629 Rep. Robert Spendlove, R-Sandy, said he “idn’ know the issue very well.\n",
      "8630 It was honestly because of Emily.\n",
      "8631 ... She did a really good job of kind of explaining the issue to me, helping me understand the inequity that existed in our existing tax system.\n",
      "8632 And once she explained it to me, it was easy for me to support it.”  Spendlove said he thinks removing the tax is “ great move for the state”nd “ow we really are on the right side of this and helping to make a vital product just a little bit less expensive.”  In June, the Salt Lake City Council created a pilot program to make menstrual products free at bathrooms in some city buildings.\n",
      "8633 And the Salt Lake City International Airport currently provides free hygiene products.\n",
      "8634 By now removing this sales tax, people have “ little bit more money in their pocket, especially when we look at women who are in need, who have low incomes,\" McCormick said.\n",
      "8635 At the October rally in Salt Lake City —eld in conjunction with similar rallies across the country and national organizations, such as PERIOD and Days for Girls —cCormick talked about local high school and college students who couldn’ afford menstrual products and instead used cotton balls with rags or Depends.\n",
      "8636 But “aybe more important is just being recognized in legislation is huge for women,”cCormick said.\n",

      "8645 ALBANY, N.Y., Dec. 22 -- Gov.\n",
      "8646 Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following press release:  Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today unveiled the 10th proposal of his 2020 State of the State agenda - eliminating the pink tax.\n",
      "8647 In the early 1990s, several studies reported disparities between the costs of substantially similar goods and services depending on if they were marketed for men or for women.\n",
      "8648 Despite increased public discourse around gender-based pricing discrimination, recent research indicates that the problem still persists.\n",
      "8649 To address these disparities, the Governor will advance legislation to prohibit gender-based pricing discrimination for substantially similar or like kind goods and services.\n",
      "8650 The legislation will require certain service providers to post price lists for standard services; businesses that violate the law would be subject to civil penalties.\n",
      "8651 \"For too long women and girls faced social and economic discrimination in all aspects of their life, but in New York we're leading the fight for true gender equity,\" Governor Cuomo said.\n",
      "8652 \"Last year we made equal pay for equal work a reality and this year we'll build on that progress by breaking down barriers that can prevent women from achieving financial success including the pink tax.\n",
      "8653 Women shouldn't be nickel and dimed their entire lives because of their gender - it's discriminatory and repugnant to our values and we're putting an end to it.\"\n",
      "8654 The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs conducted a study in 2015 that analyzed prices of toys, clothing, personal care products and home health products that were substantially similar and found that 42 percent of the time, products targeted towards women are more expensive than men's.\n",
      "8655 According to the data collected, women's merchandise costs 7 percent on average more than similar items for men, with personal care products for women found to be priced 13 percent higher than men's products.\n",
      "8656 Because these products are purchased frequently, the study estimates that the compounding differences translate into a significant financial burden for women over the cost of their lifetime.\n",
      "8657 These cost differences have lasting consequences.\n",
      "8658 Women will spend thousands more throughout the course of their lifetimes than men to get similar products, and these higher costs will disproportionately impact disposable incomes and savings.\n",
      "8659 Additionally, the gender wage gap, which hinders female economic growth and falls more heavily on women of color, is only being exacerbated by these price disparities.\n",
      "8660 During his time in office, Governor Cuomo has demonstrated his commitment to reducing the gender wage gap.\n",
      "8661 In 2016 the Governor signed legislation that prohibited a tax on menstrual products, making New York one of the first states to ban the so-called \"tampon tax.\"\n",
      "8662 In 2019, the Governor signed a new law prohibiting employers from asking about or considering an applicant's salary history when making hiring and promotion decisions, as well as legislation that mandates equal pay for substantially similar work.\n",

      "8729 Or half a dozen.\n",

      "8731 Gov.\n",
      "8732 Brian Kemp provided legislators with guardrails when he unveiled his proposed Fiscal 2021 budget on Jan. 15.\n",
      "8733 The confines will be tight, as the state’ revenue trends downward.\n",
      "8734 Yet we can expect our elected officials to employ a shoehorn rather than a scalpel —t least initially.\n",
      "8735 Foremost among the favored tax changes is an individual state income tax cut of 0.25%, which will cost the treasury approximately $500 million.\n",
      "8736 Another income tax-related item on lawmaker wish lists is an exemption for military retirement earnings, legislation championed by several members of the Savannah-area delegation.\n",
      "8737 On the sales tax side, a number of legislators want to eliminate the tampon tax, making feminine hygiene products exempt.\n",
      "8738 Then there is the portfolio of economic development incentives.\n",
      "8739 The Georgia Film Tax Credits garner the headlines, but dozens of other breaks meant to attract new industry or spur expansion of existing businesses will be floated and discussed.\n",
      "8740 Among those is a package of tax credits for economic development epicenters, including the Savannah Technology Logistics Corridor.\n",
      "8741 All existing and new proposals, including the film credits, will be heavily scrutinized in a tight budget environment.\n",
      "8742 BROAD PERSPECTIVE NEEDED  Come the 2020 session’ close, the tax environment will reflect the prism through which legislators viewed the proposed cuts and breaks.\n",
      "8743 Hopefully, all decisions will be grounded in a desire to improve the quality of life for Georgians.\n",
      "8744 An income tax cut that puts $50 annually back in the pocket of the average citizen is worthless if it handcuffs state agencies and harms their effectiveness.\n",
      "8745 Meanwhile, tax exemptions and credits that lead to the emergence of new industry and result in otherwise unattainable economic windfalls are invaluable.\n",
      "8746 Conversely, those breaks that are overly narrow or will have little downstream impact should be abandoned.\n",
      "8747 A sales tax exemption on a product that doesn’ contribute to increased economic activity is a waste.\n",
      "8748 This is an election year, and every lawmaker wants wins for his or her district or to boost his or her image with core constituencies.\n",
      "8749 A tight budget demands stress tests on cuts and breaks.\n",
      "8750 EXPAND THE STATE TAX COFFERS  Legislators can do their part to boost revenues, as well.\n",
      "8751 Senate and House leaders are already working on legislation to close a loophole in the ecommerce sales tax that denies the state an estimated $150 million a year.\n",
      "8752 With analysts saying overall collections are running $300 million behind budget, collecting those taxes will narrow the gap.\n",
      "8753 Lawmakers can also consider tweaking measures and proposals.\n",
      "8754 Lowering the income tax a quarter of a percent while mandating the new rate as a flat tax would minimize the impact.\n",
      "8755 Of course that would have ramifications for other popular tax breaks, such as the Georgia 529 College Savings Plan Credit, the Rural Hospital Tax Credit and the Georgia Qualified Education Expense Credit.\n",
      "8756 Another modification worthy of discussion involves the film credits.\n",
      "8757 The breaks have been in place since 2008 and have made Georgia the second largest film and TV production destination in the world.\n",
      "8758 The industry is firmly committed in Georgia, putting the state in a position to make adjustments.\n",
      "8759 However, legislators must tread carefully and avoid making a change that drives away business.\n",

      "9471 DETROIT —aying taxes on menstrual hygiene products could possibly come to an end because an organization has sued Michigan over the additional costs.\n",
      "9472 Advocates and an organization called Period Equity assisted three Michigan women in filing a lawsuit against the state, alleging that charging taxes \"on the purchase of menstrual products is sex-based discrimination.\"\n",
      "9473 Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, co-founder of Period Equity, called the menstrual product taxes \"unfair, inequitable and unconstitutional.\"\n",
      "9474 Weiss-Wolf said that the pandemic has added strains to people in Michigan, and relieving menstrual product taxes could help.\n",
      "9475 \"We've been working with economists in the state whose research shows that the economic environment and the circumstances of the pandemic have exacerbated the living the lives, financial status and strength of women disproportionately in the state,\" Weiss-Wolf said.\n",
      "9476 \"We think this is a reasonable and important form of tax relief that the state can offer.\"\n",
      "9477 In the lawsuit, the three women, Emily Beggs, Clare Pfeiffer and Wei Ho, allege that Michiganders are paying the 6% sales or use tax, which is adding up to almost $7 million a year.\n",
      "9478 The plaintiffs are also asking that refunds get issued to those who paid menstrual product taxes over the last four years, which the lawsuit states adds up to over $25 million.\n",
      "9479 Pfeiffer, a volunteer for I Support the Girls —etroit, says this is a need that should be addressed.\n",
      "9480 She says that menstrual products should not be a luxury item, but she's heard too often that it is.\n",
      "9481 \"We hear all the time about women having to choose whether or not to buy products, feed their families or pay their bills,\" said Pfeiffer.\n",
      "9482 \"To me, the tax on this product that only people who have periods use is unfair because it unfairly picks one sex over another to levy a tax.\"\n",
      "9483 Laura Strausfeld, co-founder of Period Equity, said that these taxes affect everyone, especially people who menstruate.\n",
      "9484 She says that bills about the taxes have been introduced many times, but meetings end without it being address.\n",
      "9485 Strausfeld said this is why they're suing.\n",
      "9486 \"It just seems even worse than it use to be that Michigan is collecting tax on medical necessities used by half the population,\" Strausfeld said.\n",
      "9487 And Michigan isn't the only state that has been sued over the menstrual product taxes.\n",
      "9488 New York and Ohio are among others where Period Equity has brought the lawsuit to the court.\n",
      "9489 \"We'd be very happy if legislatures around the country, Michigan included, finally get these bills out of committee, put them to a vote and pass them,\" said Strausfeld.\n",
      "9490 The Period Equity nonprofit campaign is working to ensure accessible menstrual products, safety and affordability.\n",
      "9491 Its \"Tampon Tax\" initiative is working to end the sales taxes in the 40 states that were still imposing them.\n",
      "9492 Since they started their initiative, 10 states have ended sales taxes on the products.\n",
      "9493 \"What's really interesting about that track record is that it's blue states, it's red states, it's Republican governors, it's Democratic governors signing those bills,\" said Weiss-Wolf.\n",

      "9499 The color registry, with the Swedish brand Intimina, takes aim at an old taboo and barrier to women’ equality.\n",
      "9500 Pantone, the color registry company, has introduced a new shade —eriod red —hat it hopes will get people talking about a part of life that often goes unmentioned.\n",
      "9501 By focusing on menstruation, Pantone said, it wants to overturn a taboo and draw attention to a regular life phase with a color that is “nergizing”nd “ynamic.”  Period red “mboldens people who menstruate to feel proud of who they are,”aid Laurie Pressman, vice president of the Pantone Color Institute.\n",
      "9502 She added that the goal was “o urge everyone, regardless of gender, to feel comfortable to talk spontaneously and openly about this pure and natural bodily function.”  The announcement is partly a marketing stunt: Pantone has teamed up with the Swedish feminine products brand Intimina, and the brand’ Seen+Heard campaign, to help make periods just a regular part of everyday life.\n",
      "9503 But there’ no arguing that attitudes toward menstruation are outdated: The average woman has her period for 2,535 days of her life, yet it continues to be a barrier to women’ equality.\n",
      "9504 In some parts of the world, women still face discrimination, miss school to manage their periods and lack clean, safe products and lavatory facilities.\n",
      "9505 And periods don’ stop for pandemics.\n",
      "9506 As the coronavirus crisis ravaged global supply chains and disrupted work and social lives, women and girls around the world were struggling to find basic essentials like pads and tampons.\n",
      "9507 In recent years, businesses and governments have taken steps to combat the stigma.\n",
      "9508 Zomato, an Indian food-delivery firm with 4,000 workers in 24 countries, introduced a paid period leave policy in August for employees dealing with cramps and stomach pains brought on by menstruation.\n",
      "9509 In 2018, Scotland became the first country to provide free sanitary products to students at schools, colleges and universities, so girls and women will no longer have to miss studies because they cannot afford sanitary products.\n",
      "9510 In early 2020, the British government followed suit.\n",
      "9511 According to Plan International UK, a girls’ights charity, one in 10 girls in Britain cannot afford sanitary wear, and nearly half of girls ages 14 to 21 are embarrassed by their periods.\n",
      "9512 Menstrual equity is a political movement as well as a marketing effort.\n",
      "9513 There are longstanding calls to abolish what is known as the “tampon tax,”r sales tax on sanitary products, in places across the United States.\n",
      "9514 Pantone is one of the most influential organizations in color forecasting and in savvy marketing, experts say, with its annual color of the year.\n",
      "9515 In 2019, the pick was a “classic blue”o mirror the world’ collective anxiety and stress.\n",

      "9523 The Awards seek to identify and honor the Most Respected C-level executives across the globe from a variety of different sectors.\n",
      "9524 The awards themselves do not focus on a company's success, as many do, but the spotlight is on the success of individuals who make the corporations tick- namely senior executives such as CEOs, Managing Directors, Directors and senior-level management.\n",
      "9525 The intention is to give a worthy individual the recognition he/she deserves as well as to use their example to inspire other companies and business leaders to achieve similar success.\n",
      "9526 Sinja, who was the outright winner in her category, 'Best CEO - Organic and Natural Feminine Care Industry', spoke to BWM about the company's achievements so far, and why its work is so important.\n",
      "9527 The Female Company has made huge strides in what has been traditionally considered a notoriously challenging business area - period products.\n",
      "9528 Periods affect around 50% of the world's population, yet the subject is still seen as taboo.\n",
      "9529 Other Important issues such as the tampon tax and the increased use of plastics in feminine hygiene products have also highlighted the fact that periods are an unavoidable part of life, with a far-reaching impact.\n",
      "9530 Women like Sinja Stadelmaier are leading a revolution that's all about challenging the way we think about periods; making quality, environmentally friendly female care products available to all.\n",
      "9531 Born and raised in a small town just outside of Stuttgart, Germany, Sinja met the company's co-founder at university and they have been on a mission to make life better for women ever since.\n",
      "9532 They soon discovered huge issues in the industry, including the fact that many women in Germany (and around the world) are unable to afford suitable sanitary products, adding to the shame and discomfort associated with periods.\n",
      "9533 The Female Company has been at the forefront of major campaigns, leading to the reduction of tampon tax from 19% to 7% in Germany, as well as producing products that are better for the female body and the environment.\n",
      "9534 Their period products, which include tampons, bandages, panty liners and menstrual cups, are made from certified organic cotton, with no harmful chemicals or pesticides, and produced to high social standards.\n",
      "9535 The overall effect is the creation of products that are attractive, honest and kind - not shameful necessities to be hidden away.\n",
      "9536 The award Best CEO - Organic and Natural Feminine Care Industry is the first of its kind.\n",
      "9537 Sinja told BWM what it means to her to be the outright winner in the category.\n",
      "9538 \"Our vision is to empower women to be proud in their womanhood and I honestly could not be more proud to be the first to win the award in the category of feminine hygiene industry with The Female Company.\"\n",

      "9543 Hollywood stylist Karla Welch has worked her disruptive aesthetic on Justin Bieber, Stella Artois, Levi’ denim and Hanes Ts, and now she is turning her attention to the $26 billion global menstrual hygiene market with The Period Company.\n",
      "9544 Founded by Welch and branding guru Sasha Markova, formerly executive creative director of Impossible Foods, the health and wellness start-up offers six styles of period underwear starting at $12 for women and teens, including adaptable and trans boxers.\n",
      "9545 The Period Company branding wraps in self-empowerment and sustainability (each year in the U.S., approximately 12 billion pads and seven billion tampons end up in landfills) with a call to activism, highlighting in launch communications how little innovation has occurred since the tampon was invented “y a man”n 1931.\n",
      "9546 In the works for four years, the brand came out of Welch’ own experience with her teen.\n",
      "9547 “he genesis was making Clem’ period the best experience possible and reducing the waste around my own,”he said, explaining that making a global sustainability impact around menstruation required making period underwear more affordable than what’ already on the market, and offering fully compostable packaging.\n",
      "9548 The politically-outspoken stylist is also aiming to destigmatize menstruation.\n",
      "9549 Case in point, a launch video featuring Welch at the sink rinsing her own period blood from the underwear.\n",
      "9550 “nstead of telling people what to do, we’e hoping they ask themselves questions.\n",
      "9551 If this grosses you out, ask yourself why.…eligion and patriarchy have turned us against the earth and our own bodies, but we’e not ashamed.”  The product is currently available online at period.co.\n",
      "9552 When shipping to the 30 U.S. states that still have the so-called “tampon tax”n hygiene products (rather than including them among such tax-free necessities as groceries, medical supplies and even Viagra), The Period Company will cover the tax.\n",
      "9553 The brand will begin wholesaling in early 2021, with an eye toward selling at Target, Walmart, Whole Foods and other mass retailers.\n",
      "9554 The underwear is made of organic cotton with four layers of absorbency.\n",
      "9555 “e’e not fancy La Perla, we’e like good comfy Jockey.\n",
      "9556 We’e your period underwear that you already wore, but it actually does the job it’ supposed to do,”aid Welch, adding that they made a deliberate choice not to include any odor-reducing metals, which can be toxic.\n",
      "9557 In future, she plans to add holiday colors, skin tones and sport styles, as well as lower absorbency options.\n",
      "9558 “ wouldn’ call it a fashion category, it’ menstrual health.\n",
      "9559 But it’ also great for incontinence,”aid the stylist.\n",
      "9560 “hat’ another huge area that has been neglected.\n",

      "9562 Why should we be satisfied with a diaper?”  While the pandemic delayed the launch by a month or two, it reinvigorated the mission, Welch said.\n",

      "9569 When Anisha Abraham’ aunt passed away from uterine cancer in April, the news came as a wakeup call.\n",
      "9570 “he always knew that something was wrong,”braham said.\n",
      "9571 But the stigma around gynecological care pushed her aunt to postpone a checkup.\n",
      "9572 And having experienced gynecological pain herself, Abraham decided to see a doctor.\n",
      "9573 The passing of a loved one was “he little push I needed to seek help,”aid Abraham, a 17-year-old Palm Harbor University High School senior.\n",
      "9574 “f there wasn’ such a stigma, I really feel like less women would postpone treatment.”  Since then, Abraham has started to write biweekly blog posts about women’ health.\n",
      "9575 She also kick-started the Pink Power Project, aimed at breaking down stigmas and organizing donation drives for menstrual hygiene products across Pinellas County.\n",
      "9576 Her efforts are focused on tackling period poverty, the inability to access feminine hygiene products and supplies, particularly among low-income people.\n",
      "9577 Similar to food access and homelessness, the inequities surrounding access to period products have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "9578 Some women, girls, transgender and nonbinary individuals may have been able to access these supplies in schools, public facilities or workplaces prior to the pandemic.\n",
      "9579 For some, job loss, work from home, and virtual schooling have limited access to period products.\n",
      "9580 And although access has dwindled, the need persists.\n",
      "9581 Prior to the pandemic, one in four women said they have struggled to afford feminine hygiene products in the past year due to lack of income, according to a survey conducted by YouGov on behalf of U by Kotex, a brand of feminine hygiene products.\n",
      "9582 And in 2019, one in four teens across the country said they have missed school due to lack of period supplies, according to the Alliance for Period Supplies.\n",
      "9583 In Florida, one in six women and girls between the ages of 12 and 44 live below the federal poverty line, data from the alliance shows.\n",
      "9584 But those fighting to close the access gap say the need is not exclusive to low-income individuals.\n",
      "9585 “t’ your colleague, it’ the person next to you, it’ everyone,”aid Lyndsey Siara, chair of the Junior League of Tampa’ Diaper Bank, which recently started focusing on period product initiatives.\n",
      "9586 Some states employ a “tampon tax,”ncreasing the cost of feminine hygiene products and further perpetuating inequities.\n",
      "9587 In 2017, then-Governor Rick Scott signed a law exempting such products from taxation — step that lessened the cost burden but did not end the problem.\n",
      "9588 A 2019 survey of 2,000 women aged 18 to 55 revealed the average woman spends more than $6,300 on menstrual products in her lifetime.\n",
      "9589 The survey was conducted by OnePoll for INTIMINA, another feminine hygiene brand that sells menstrual cups, a reusable alternative for pads and tampons.\n",
      "9590 Other estimates of just tampons alone —ot including products like panty liners, the need to buy clean underwear, and period cramp pain management methods —ut the lifetime total at just under $2,000 over an individual’ reproductive age.\n",
      "9591 For women with endometriosis, a disorder characterized by extremely heavy and painful periods, the cost rises significantly.\n",
      "9592 One study published in the Human Reproduction Update in 2007 estimated that these individuals may pay upwards of $2,800 per year in medical expenses, which does not account for lost wages due to days off work.\n",
      "9593 Those receiving nutrition assistance through federal and state programs are not allowed to use those benefits for period products, Siara said.\n",
      "9594 Since the pandemic started, one in three parents report being worried about the ability to afford period products, according to Always, another feminine hygiene brand.\n",
      "9595 The Junior League of Tampa has seen an increase in demand for basic need supplies, including diapers and period products.\n",
      "9596 From August to early October, the group donated just over 11,000 period products.\n",
      "9597 And those donations are having the largest impact on elementary schools.\n",
      "9598 “his is a child welfare issue,”aid Caroline Foss, the basic needs strategic advisor for the Junior League.\n",
      "9599 “his isn’ a high school or college problem.”  In schools with younger students, supply for feminine hygiene products may be low as the average age for a girl’ first period is 12 years old.\n",
      "9600 Yet, girls as young as age 9 are beginning to menstruate, underscoring the need for accessible period products and women’ health education for youth and adults alike.\n",
      "9601 However, working with schools has proven difficult, according to Foss.\n",
      "9602 Often period education gets conflated with sex education, she said, limiting opportunities to increase awareness around feminine hygiene.\n",
      "9603 “e’e not able to have open conversations and open distribution,”oss said.\n",
      "9604 Teens like Abraham have been chipping away at education gaps and limited period product access.\n",
      "9605 Abraham hosts drives where people can donate used clothing.\n",
      "9606 She then sells those items and uses the proceeds to purchase period products.\n",
      "9607 The products are donated to local food banks or shelters.\n",
      "9608 When she got the idea, Abraham was looking to mobilize teenagers like herself who may not have money, but had clothes they no longer use.\n",
      "9609 Hillsborough High School sophomore Aanya Patel has been pursuing a similar mission.\n",
      "9610 During a virtual global forum this summer, Patel learned about period poverty and was inspired to start her nonprofit, Global Girls Initiative.\n",
      "9611 On Oct. 10, National Period Day, she launched a project called “eriods in the Pandemic: No Girl Left Behind,”hich helps provide pads to low-income and homeless families as well as domestic violence shelters in Tampa.\n",
      "9612 Her goal started with collecting 10,000 pads and has since expanded to 50,000 as support poured in.\n",
      "9613 In addition, Patel has started a GoFundMe to raise $4,000 for the project, which she says she’ close to reaching.\n",
      "9614 “eople are losing their jobs in this pandemic and they can’ afford food much less menstrual products,”atel said.\n",
      "9615 Since its launch, the project has expanded to include partnerships with Hillsborough County Public Schools to distribute supplies and the University of Tampa, where she held a period product drive on campus.\n",
      "9616 For Patel, 15, donations are one piece of the puzzle.\n",
      "9617 She started a social media campaign aimed at debunking menstrual hygiene myths and menstrual health stigma.\n",
      "9618 Now she’ promoting the use of environmentally sustainable products, such as menstrual cups or biodegradable pads.\n",
      "9619 “ can buy (period supplies), and I can afford it,”atel said.\n",
      "9620 “hy not take it one step further with sustainability?”  Her local success has pushed her to think globally.\n",
      "9621 Now working with six villages in India, she hopes to donate a 6-month supply of period products to 100 girls.\n",
      "9622 She chose India because of her heritage.\n",
      "9623 Her mom is from Gujarat, a state on the west coast of India.\n",

      "9636 The news was celebrated by activists who have argued for years that these essential products are too expensive and too difficult for many women and girls to access.\n",
      "9637 So that got us thinking about what things are like here in the U.S., especially since the coronavirus pandemic has thrown many people's budgets and schedules into chaos.\n",
      "9638 So we called Jennifer Weiss-Wolf.\n",
      "9639 She is the co-founder of Period Equity.\n",
      "9640 That is an organization founded to ensure accessible, affordable and safe menstruation products in this country.\n",
      "9641 She's with us now.\n",
      "9642 Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, thank you so much for joining us today.\n",
      "9643 JENNIFER WEISS-WOLF: Thanks so much for having me.\n",
      "9644 MARTIN: So I just think that for many people who haven't spent any time thinking about this, they might think about this as a personal issue.\n",
      "9645 But you argue that it should be a matter of public policy, also.\n",
      "9646 So for people who aren't familiar with this discussion, just what exactly are you and advocates calling for?\n",
      "9647 What is the problem that you think needs to be addressed?\n",
      "9648 WEISS-WOLF: We've kind of created this frame and phrase for it called menstrual equity.\n",
      "9649 And, really, what that is all about is ensuring equitable access to menstrual products such that nobody is actually held back from participating in daily life, succeeding in all of the things that, you know, matter to all of us - whether it's going to school, going to work - on account of menstruation and inability to afford menstrual products.\n",
      "9650 MARTIN: So what are some of the issues here in the United States that you think people need to think more about?\n",
      "9651 I mean, first of all, let's say taxes.\n",
      "9652 Are sales taxes imposed on these feminine hygiene products?\n",
      "9653 Can you buy feminine hygiene products with food stamps, for example, with SNAP benefits if you are of very low income?\n"

      "9654 What are some of the things that are particular to the United States that you think people may not know?\n",
      "9655 WEISS-WOLF: So you asked about sales taxes.\n",
      "9656 And that's been a pretty live campaign here in the United States for many years, where, right now, there are - 30 of the 50 states actually don't exempt menstrual products from sales tax.\n",
      "9657 Twenty of them do, and 10 of those the result of a very coordinated campaign going back about five years now to demand that legislatures do better and exempt menstrual products from sales tax.\n",
      "9658 You asked about SNAP and WIC.\n",
      "9659 Neither of those programs include menstrual products as part of their - you know, the things that you're able to purchase with those benefits.\n",
      "9660 So there are many, many ways that these products prove unaffordable and inaccessible for many people but that we could use and leverage public policy to change that.\n",
      "9661 Again, fighting for the tampon tax, as it's publicly called, is one of those ways.\n",
      "9662 But there have been other legislative advances, too, that quite frankly mirror what happened in Scotland this past week, where six states have mandated provision of menstrual products in their schools, and 13 states have mandated provision of menstrual products for people who are incarcerated.\n",
      "9663 MARTIN: OK.\n",
      "9664 But before we let you go, we will soon have a new administration.\n",
      "9665 What are two suggestions for what you think this incoming administration could do to make people's lives easier, who, as I said - you know?\n",
      "9666 Half the population at some point in their lives needs these products.\n",
      "9667 WEISS-WOLF: OK.\n",
      "9668 So some of the specifics, actually, that they can do are included in this live legislation called the Menstrual Equity For All Act.\n",
      "9669 So among those provisions, there could be an earned income tax credit for low-income people who need to purchase menstrual products.\n",
      "9670 There is a provision that would require states that accept federal funding for their criminal justice systems to provide menstrual products in state prisons in order to receive those federal funds.\n",
      "9671 Those are some examples of how federal levers can be pulled to ensure that states and citizens on the ground have access to more affordable menstrual products.\n",
      "9672 MARTIN: But what about people who aren't in prison?\n",
      "9673 I mean, what about people who work these long hours, don't necessarily have breaks or maybe they have the same break that a man would have but they don't need to do the same thing on their break that a man would - you know?\n",
      "9674 - that what women need to do to take care of themselves is different on a break.\n",
      "9675 Is there something that the government could do to make that less challenging?\n",
      "9676 WEISS-WOLF: I think that just government and the federal government, in particular, talking about, embracing, acknowledging menstruation in and of itself will spur states and other jurisdictions to take action.\n",
      "9677 I mean, and that's kind of how this has worked here in the United States.\n",
      "9678 It's been a bit of a two-way street.\n",
      "9679 There are some things that are better dealt with at the local and state level.\n",
      "9680 There are some things that - there are federal levers that can be pulled that will nudge us towards change but actually really aren't the cure-all because that's, again, not necessarily how our systems work.\n",
      "9681 But there's an echo chamber that we can call to ensure that everybody - and especially our lawmakers - are speaking about menstruation and the economics of menstruation and the health of menstruation and the idea that people who exist in the workplace, in schools, in our economy are people who menstruate and that we can't be silent about it because we're all - we all need to be called upon to be part of sort of the creative thought process about how to make the changes that will improve people's lives, especially when it comes to menstruation.\n",
      "9682 MARTIN: That was Jennifer Weiss-Wolf.\n",
      "9683 She's co-founder of the group Period Equity, and she's author of \"Periods Gone Public: Taking A Stand For Menstrual Equity.\"\n",

      "9734 MediaPost.com   There may be dozens of disruptive new brands reinventing the menstrual products, but hats off to 100-year-old Kotex for a funny first.\n",
      "9735 Working with a popular YouTube creator Simone Giertz, Google and Ogilvy Chicago, Kimberly-Clark has invented a genuine Menstruation Machine to dispel universal confusion about how monthly periods work.\n",
      "9736 \"The goal is to demystify periods to help reduce stigma.\n",
      "9737 And we wanted a fun way to show how little people know about the way menstruation works,\" says Sarah Paulsen, senior global creative and design director for Kimberly-Clark's adult and feminine care brands.\n",
      "9738 She says some of the insights from the science and R&D teams even astounded the feminine-care creative group.\n",
      "9739 There are 800 million people having their period every day?\n",
      "9740 That fertilization takes place in the Fallopian tubes, not the uterus?\n",
      "9741 Or the average menstrual cramp exerts 2.3 pounds of pressure per square inch, enough to empty a tube of toothpaste or dent an empty soda can?\n",
      "9742 Minds.\n",
      "9743 Blown.\n",
      "9744 Paulsen says the approach came together, in large part, because of Giertz's unique personality and delivery.\n",
      "9745 (Among her STEM-can-be-funny videos, which have collected tens of millions of views: She's turned her Tesla into a pickup truck, become weightless in her DIY astronaut training device, and built a coffee table out of 20,000 matches.)\n",
      "9746 She brings her quirky style of curiosity and explanation to the period project, right down to her homemade tampon necklace and ovary headband.\n",
      "9747 Paulsen says that while the launch is timed to Menstrual Hygiene Day May 28, \"we have many ideas to keep this activation going across many different platforms.\n",
      "9748 YouTube has been an amazing platform for us because it's so popular with younger people who use it to search for content.\"\n",
      "9749 The videos are the latest addition to Kotex's \"She Can Initiative,\" a global effort aimed at promoting menstrual hygiene -- which means, in part, \"adequate sanitation facilities and access to feminine hygiene products,\" according to Wikipedia.\n",
      "9750 To further those goals, Kotex is also partnering with groups like Plan International and WASH United.\n",
      "9751 Once full of chaste print ads and weird euphemisms, the feminine care category has become a playground for young creators looking to shatter taboos.\n",
      "9752 Product innovations range from disposable period underwear to reusable tampons.\n",
      "9753 And cause-related efforts, from ending period poverty to banning the tampon tax, are part of young women's daily social-media swirl.\n",
      "9754 Paulsen says that awareness meant Kotex had to look for something engaging and sharable, as well as educational.\n",
      "9755 \"We wanted to drive menstrual-hygiene awareness and make it more entertaining to watch,\" she tells Marketing Daily.\n",
      "9756 \"So we fed Simone a lot of the science nuggets, and she 100% took it from there, building the machines herself.\n",
      "9757 We'd never seen anything like this before.\"\n",
      "9758 While Paulsen expects young women to be the prime audience, she points out that the brand is increasingly trying to bring young men into conversations about periods, too.\n",
      "9759 A new brand video launched in Brazil, for example, shows a young boy passing a Kotex back to the girl sitting behind him in class.\n",
      "9760 Paulsen concedes that it's challenging to try and keep up with the disruptors.\n",
      "9761 \"We're experimenting with many of these new products too, and for us, it's about continually testing and learning.\n",
      "9762 We recently launched reusables in Australia, for example.\n",
      "9763 And yes, there are a lot of efforts in this space -- but it's a huge problem to solve.\"\n",

      "9765 All rights reserved.\n",
      "9766 Nadya Okamoto has been encouraging women to talk about their periods for at least seven or eight years.\n",
      "9767 “eriods are not these shameful things that we should not be thinking about,”kamoto told WWD over the phone.\n",
      "9768 She talks excitedly and rapidly without pause, often repeating herself for emphasis.\n",
      "9769 “eriods make human life possible and we need to make better period care that’ better for our bodies and better for the environment and better for the earth.”  This passion for periods can be traced back to 2014.\n",
      "9770 Back then she was in high school and would regularly come across the same homeless women on her way to school.\n",
      "9771 They would tell her stories about using toilet paper, socks, brown paper grocery bags or even cardboard boxes to take care of their periods.\n",
      "9772 “ had never thought about period poverty before,”aid Okamoto, referring to the inability to afford menstrual products.\n",
      "9773 “t was a really big privilege check.”   She quickly mobilized Period.org, a nonprofit that delivers feminine hygiene products to women in places of need, like schools, shelters and prisons.\n",
      "9774 Four years later, Okamoto quite literally wrote the book on menstruation with “eriod Power.”   Now, the influencer, entrepreneur and recent Harvard graduate is taking her fervor for fem care to the next level.\n",
      "9775 Earlier this month, Okamoto not-so-quietly launched August, the direct-to-consumer period care products brand, alongside cofounder Nick Jain.\n",
      "9776 The duo raised 1.95 million in a seed round, with investors such as venture capital firm Hannah Grey; investment firm and brand agency Bullish; former Glossier executives and founders of Chord, a platform that helps brands launch online, Henry Davis and Bryan Mahoney; “lack Panther”ctor Winston Duke; innerwear brand Lively founder Michelle Cordeiro Grant, and former Refinery29 president Amy Emmerich, among others.\n",
      "9777 “n a space where brands are continuing to play it safe, August is channeling their personal experiences to create a bold brand, unique products and period positive conversations,”aid Sali Christeson, founder and chief executive officer of Argent, an e-commerce site for professional women’ workwear that also offers styling tips, and another investor.\n",
      "9778 Of course, disruption in the feminine hygiene industry isn’ entirely new.\n",
      "9779 Thinx has been offering period underwear —nderwear that you can bleed right into —or more than a decade.\n",
      "9780 There’ also Knix, Ruby Love and Karla Welch’ The Period Company, all of which sell reusable period underwear or reusable pads.\n",
      "9781 Direct-to-consumer period brand Saalt recently became available at Neiman Marcus.\n",
      "9782 Thinx and Adidas both launched period activewear this year.\n",
      "9783 Okamoto said what makes August different is that it offers sanitary products —ampons, pads and liners —hat can be thrown away, by way of a subscription model.\n",
      "9784 “iterally like 90 percent of the people we talked to who were in our Gen Z demographic used tampons and pads,”he explained.\n",
      "9785 “o we were, like, how do we take this product that people are using and make it more sustainable?”  To start with, August’ pads don’ contain plastic, are made from 100 percent organic cotton and are biodegradable within 12 months.\n",
      "9786 The brand is also carbon neutral throughout its supply chain and donates a portion of each sale to initiatives that oppose the so-called “Tampon Tax,”r tax on period products in certain states across the nation.\n",
      "9787 In addition, shoppers can ask all of their otherwise embarrassing menstrual questions in the “sk August”ection on Itsaugust.co and track how products were made.\n",
      "9788 “o it’ hyper traceable and transparent,”kamoto said.\n",
      "9789 “ wanted to create a brand that actually does stand for this culture shift.”   Okamoto’ first order of business was to include actual period blood in the brand’ launch video.\n",
      "9790 “hat, unfortunately, meant we could not put money behind it on Facebook, because it’ considered violent and graphic content,”he said.\n",
      "9791 “ut for me, I was, like, we need to stop this, stop companies actually partaking in perpetuating these stigmas around periods.\n",
      "9792 “f you look at how period products have been sold over the last century, it’ been around, buy our products to hide your period, or forget you have a period, using blue liquid because actual periods are too gross to show,”kamoto continued.\n",
      "9793 “ven still in some cases we don’ feel comfortable saying the word ‘eriod.’he idea [behind August is] of making periods more of this talked about experience.”    This is exactly why Hannah Grey, which led the fundraising round, said it wanted to invest in August.\n",
      "9794 “adya and Nick have strong opinions around the brand tone and the type of products they are architecting, with sustainability, scalable impact and accountability being top priorities,”aid Kate Shillo Beardsley, one of the founding partners at the venture capital firm.\n",
      "9795 “ugust is well positioned to support the needs and desires of Gen Z in a way that traditional period care products have not.”  Emmerich said one of the reasons she was drawn to August and decided to invest in the company is because it’ not just trying to reach young people —t’ run by young people, too.\n",
      "9796 “here’ nothing like it in the market,”he said.\n",
      "9797 “pportunity for August in the market is wide open.\n",
      "9798 There have only been a few new brands aimed toward younger women, but none have been built by a younger inclusive community with their own generation in mind.”  In fact, Okamoto and Jain, who are 23 and 22, respectively, said August’ youngest team member is 13.\n",
      "9799 “ lot of brands can talk about reaching young people and trying to relate.\n",
      "9800 But we are that community,”kamoto said.\n",
      "9801 “ think that really makes a difference.\n",
      "9802 Our whole idea is that we can co-create products with them.”   She’ quick to add, however, that August is for everyone, including nonbinary individuals and trans men.\n",
      "9803 That helps explain the diversity of both the community and investors.\n",
      "9804 “upporting and investing in August, Nadya and Nick, was an absolute no-brainer,”aid Michelle Cordeiro Grant, founder of innerwear brand Lively and one of August’ angel investors.\n",
      "9805 “ firmly believe in the power of community and brand above all else when creating a strong and long lasting consumer business, one that not only has an incredible product, but also brings people, conversations and education to the forefront of the brand.\n",
      "9806 Nadya and Nick are doing just this.”  August subscription prices range from $10 to $12 a box, depending on how often shoppers make a purchase.\n",
      "9807 Okamoto said at present there are no plans to move into the period apparel space.\n",
      "9808 Although there are some August hoodies available on the website.\n",
      "9809 “ut we do very much have plans to have an efficient product development roadmap where we can be innovating on period care in general,”he said.\n",
      "9810 “o we’e having conversations on how do you actually innovate on period care?\n",
      "9811 “rands have the resources and the responsibility to devote themselves to making an impact with better product,”he added.\n",
      "9812 “nd I think period products have played a very succinct role in shaping the period stigma.\n",
      "9813 I think that the terrifying part of starting a company is that everything I’ telling you I believe wholeheartedly.\n",

      "9818 People with low incomes can feel ashamed to talk about their challenges, she said.\n",
      "9819 'Women don't come to their physician and tell them that they can't afford pads and tampons and menstrual cups and period underwear and all those sorts of things,' Banfield said.\n",
      "9820 'For many people, poverty imparts a feeling of shame …hen they can't provide for their own needs.'\n",
      "9821 Financial barriers, stigma and poor education around menstrual cycles have forced many into period poverty, defined as inadequate access to menstrual hygiene products and education.\n",
      "9822 The problem has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic, Banfield said.\n",
      "9823 As state and local officials become more aware of the issue, states have passed laws to exempt feminine hygiene products from sales taxes or ensure schools are equipped with free products.\n",
      "9824 Louisiana, Maine and Vermont this year joined Washington, D.C., and 20 other states that have either ended sales taxes for menstrual products or never had a tax in place, according to Period Equity, a legal organization based in New York that focuses on menstrual equity.\n",
      "9825 Lawmakers in 17 additional states introduced sales tax proposals that failed or have not passed.\n",
      "9826 Five states-Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon-don't have any sales taxes.\n",
      "9827 Advocates say this is a step in the right direction, but they argue that states must also work to reduce cultural and social stigmas, make products free in publicly available places and invest in sexual education.\n",
      "9828 'Those legislative ideas are just a small handful of the kinds of ways we can use policy to eradicate both challenges to access as well as stigma,' said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, co-founder of Period Equity.\n",
      "9829 'It's not just that people are embarrassed or [feel] shame, but that we don't actually pursue progressive or proactive solutions because we just are choosing to not talk about it.'\n",
      "9830 The laws have their critics.\n",
      "9831 Some opponents argue that states need that revenue to fund education and other services.\n",
      "9832 Period Equity estimated that the 27 states with menstrual product sales taxes receive a total of $119.7 million in revenue from those taxes a year.\n",
      "9833 Earlier this year, New Hampshire Republican lawmakers introduced legislation that would have reversed a previous law that requires schools to provide free tampons and sanitary napkins to students.\n",
      "9834 Proponents of the bill said it would release schools from the financial burden of paying for the products.\n",
      "9835 The proposal died when the legislature adjourned.\n",
      "9836 'I don't think the state of New Hampshire should be micromanaging schools regarding how and where to provide these products,' said state GOP Rep. Judy Aron, according to the Concord Monitor.\n",
      "9837 'Those things should be left up to the discretion of the school administration.'\n",
      "9838 Mental Health Effects  Women of color in the United States are more likely to experience poverty than White women, so they're also more likely to have trouble paying for period supplies.\n",
      "9839 Experts cannot quantify the extent of period poverty in the United States because research on menstrual health is limited.\n",
      "9840 However, a 2019 study published in Obstetrics and Gynecology found nearly 64% of surveyed low-income women in St. Louis, Missouri, could not afford menstrual hygiene supplies during the previous year.\n",
      "9841 About 46% of the women could not afford to pay for food and menstrual products, and 21% were unable to afford products on a monthly basis.\n",
      "9842 One-third of them used cloth, rags, tissues or toilet paper, the study found, whereas others used children's diapers or paper towels because they didn't have pads or tampons.\n",
      "9843 The inability to afford clean sanitary products can affect women's mental health.\n",
      "9844 A study published in January in BMC Women's Health found that 68% of college students who reported experiencing period poverty monthly also reported moderate or severe depression.\n",
      "9845 Other health risks, Banfield said, include toxic shock syndrome, a rare and potentially fatal medical condition caused by bacterial infection; recurrent discharge from lengthy tampon use; rashes; and inflammation, all of which can result in physical and mental trauma.\n",
      "9846 Pads and menstrual cups can help, she said, but their cost is a barrier.\n",
      "9847 There are additional hurdles for people who get their periods but don't identify as women and girls, including transgender boys and men, and individuals who are nonbinary.\n",
      "9848 Some schools, for example, might provide products in girls' restrooms but not in those for boys.\n",
      "9849 Costs are as variable as menstrual cycles.\n",
      "9850 An online period product calculator published by statistics firm Omni Calculator found the average woman spends about $10 a month on menstrual products, which includes tampons, pads or menstrual cups.\n",
      "9851 This doesn't account for pain pills, wipes or other items.\n",
      "9852 Prices can vary depending on the brand of items or the heaviness of the menstrual cycle.\n",
      "9853 The items' necessity, advocates say, is why they should be exempt from sales tax and provided for free in schools.\n",
      "9854 On the first day of July, Maine Gov.\n",
      "9855 Janet Mills, a Democrat, signed a revised biennial budget bill into law that ends the sales tax on feminine hygiene products beginning Oct. 1.\n",
      "9856 The month before, Louisiana's and Vermont's governors signed similar laws to eliminate the so-called tampon tax.\n",
      "9857 Louisiana also got rid of sales taxes for children's and adult diapers.\n",
      "9858 In Vermont, state revenues are up as a result of federal COVID-19 relief aid.\n",
      "9859 That was one of the reasonsthe sales tax bill was easier to pass this time around than in previous years, Sen. Ruth Hardy, a Democrat who co-sponsored the measure, told Stateline.\n",
      "9860 'It made it an opportune year to make sure this legislation passed and made it easier for people to say yes who did not in the past,' Hardy said.\n",
      "9861 Another law, Hardy added, mandates that schools make period products available in most gender-neutral and girls' bathrooms.\n",
      "9862 Student Leadership  As with many national social movements, young people have been on the frontlines of the menstrual equity push.\n",
      "9863 In 2020, students across the country raised money, lobbied, held school assemblies and launched social media campaigns to make period products free in their schools, The Wall Street Journalreported.\n",
      "9864 In Washington state, middle school students created a GoFundMe account to buy products to place in schools.\n",
      "9865 Washington Gov.\n",
      "9866 Jay Inslee, a Democrat, signed legislation this session that requires schools, colleges and universities to provide free products in all gender-neutral and girls' bathrooms.\n",
      "9867 Last year, Inslee also signed a bill that exempts the products from the state's sales tax.\n",
      "9868 So far, at least eight states require schools to offer free tampons and pads to students, said Weiss-Wolf.\n",
      "9869 School closures during the COVID-19 pandemic made it harder for students to access pads and tampons.\n",
      "9870 About 23% of pupils have struggled to afford period products, according to a 2021 study by PERIOD, a youth-led nonprofit that strives to eradicate period poverty, and Thinx, a feminine hygiene company.\n",
      "9871 About 27% of students said being in school has made it easier to get supplies, the study found.\n",
      "9872 About 50% of students said they wore period products longer than recommended.\n",
      "9873 'Returning to school alone will not solve the challenges students face.\n",
      "9874 Students do not think schools foster an environment in which they feel comfortable discussing periods or even attending class while they are on their periods,' the authors of the report wrote.\n",
      "9875 'This stigma and lack of access can have a very real impact on a student's education, especially for students of color and lower-income students who tend to be more impacted by lack of access to products.'\n",
      "9876 States have moved slowly even with the national push to eliminate the taxes, Banfield said, but she said poverty should be treated as a medical, socioeconomic and educational issue, and that period poverty should be treated as a public health crisis.\n",
      "9877 'This is not your Starbucks that you're having in the morning because you want to have it.\n",
      "9878 These are things that you need,' Banfield said.\n",
